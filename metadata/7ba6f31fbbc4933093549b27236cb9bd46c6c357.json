The show centers on protagonist Jackson &quot;Jax&quot; Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the then?vice president of the club, who begins questioning the club and himself.\n\nSons of Anarchy premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The third season of the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX's highest rated series ever, surpassing FX's other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me. The season 4 and 5 premieres (&quot;Out&quot; and &quot;Sovereign&quot;, respectively), both directed by series executive producer and principal director Paris Barclay and written by series creator and executive producer Kurt Sutter (along with staff writers Brady Dahl and Roberto Patino), were the two highest-rated telecasts in FX's history.\n\nThe sixth season aired from September 10 through December 10, 2013. Those involved in the production of the series imply that creator Kurt Sutter plans a seventh and final season.\n\nIn November 2013, Kurt Sutter indicated that he was in talks with FX to make a Sons of Anarchy prequel set in the 1960's.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba6f31fbbc4933093549b27236cb9bd46c6c357","amp;dn":"Sons+of+Anarchy+Seasons+1-6+%2B+Extras+BDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba6f31fbbc4933093549b27236cb9bd46c6c357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,166,243,31,187,196,147,48,147,84,155,39,35,108,185,189,70,198,195,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
