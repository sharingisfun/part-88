Hundreds of thousands followed the account, Goldman Sachs launched an internal investigation, and when the true identity of the man behind it all was revealed, it created a national media sensationÃ¢â‚¬â€but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only part of the story.\n\nWhere @GSElevator captured the essence of the banking elite with curated jokes and submissions overheard by readers, Straight to hell adds John LeFevreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own storyÃ¢â‚¬â€an unapologetic and darkly funny account of a career as a globe-conquering investment banker spanning New York, London, and Hong Kong. Straight to Hell pulls back the curtain on a world that is both hated and envied, taking readers from the trading floors and roadshows to private planes and after-hours overindulgence. Full of shocking lawlessness, boyish antics, and win-at-all-costs schemes, this is the definitive take on the deviant, dysfunctional, and absolutely excessive world of finance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb630186f3cdb49cc261f18de7806a46f2fd64bb","amp;dn":"Straight+to+Hell%3A+True+Tales+of+Deviance%2C+Debauchery%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb630186f3cdb49cc261f18de7806a46f2fd64bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,99,1,134,243,205,180,156,194,97,241,141,231,128,106,70,242,253,100,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
