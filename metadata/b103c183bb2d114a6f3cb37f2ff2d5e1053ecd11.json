The real meat of the collection is that CD of 20 hits and staples, the songs that made the Specials one of the most vital bands of the early '80s: all the early singles -- &quot;Gangsters,&quot; &quot;Ghost Town,&quot; &quot;Message to You Rudy,&quot; &quot;Nite Klub&quot; -- but also &quot;Rat Race,&quot; &quot;Stereotypes,&quot; &quot;What I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend,&quot; &quot;Racist Friend,&quot; and &quot;Nelson Mandela.&quot; All these and more are here on a compilation that encompasses the entirety of their dynamic, sometimes chaotic, career and while their debut remains peerless, this is a good way to get a sense of the whole story.\nArtist...............:The Specials\nAlbum................: The Best of\nGenre................: Ska\nSource...............: CD/DVD\nReleased.................: 2008\nRipper...............: dBpowerAmp\nQuality..............: MP3 VBRV0 Extreme\nTracklisting\n1\nGangsters\n\n2\nA Message to You Rudy\n\n3\nNite Klub\n\n4\nConcrete Jungle\n\n5\nToo Much Too Young\n\n6\nBlank Expression\n\n7\nDoesn't Make It Alright\n\n8\nRude Boys Outta Jail\n\n9\nRat Race\n\n10\nMan at C &amp; A\n\n11\nDo Nothing\n\n12\nStereotypes\n\n13\nInternational Jet Set\n\n14\nFriday Night, Saturday Morning\n\n15\nWhy?\n\n16\nGhost Town\n\n17\nWhat I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend\n\n18\nRacist Friend\n\n19\nWar Crimes (The Crime Remains the Same)\n\n20\nFree Nelson Mandela\n\nDVD\n1\nGangsters\n2\nA Message to You Rudy\n\n3\nToo Much Too Young\n\n4\nRat Race\n\n5\nDo Nothing\n\n6\nEnjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)\n\n7\nGhost Town\n\n8\nBright Lights\n\n9\nThe Lonely Crowd\n\n10\nHousebound\n\n11\nAlcohol\n\n12\nRacist Friend\n\n13\nWar Crimes (The Crime Remains the Same)\n\n14\nFree Nelson Mandela\n\n15\nBreak Down the Door\n\n16\nWhat I Like Most About You Is Your Girlfriend","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b103c183bb2d114a6f3cb37f2ff2d5e1053ecd11","amp;dn":"The+Specials+Best+of....%28CD%2BDVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b103c183bb2d114a6f3cb37f2ff2d5e1053ecd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,3,193,131,187,45,17,74,111,60,179,127,47,242,213,225,5,62,205,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
