While the owner is whisked away, Alan designs the new-look garden - taking inspiration from the best gardens in the area and asking for help from local people and the owner's friends in completing the project.\n\n\n1)  Walsall \nThe programme returns with Alan Titchmarsh and his team travelling to Walsall to surprise young widow Nina Perrin Seedhouse. Her husband Gareth died last year after battling cancer, so it's up to the green-fingered experts to finish the dream garden he was going to create for his family.\n\n2)  Moorland, Somerset \nIn Moorland, Somerset, Alan Titchmarsh surprises the Colquhouns, a couple devastated by the floods of 2014, which arrived in the wake of a major health problem. Sheila had to undergo treatment for breast cancer, but after moving back home, in the year the couple will retire and celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, Alan and the team attempt to transform their flood-wrecked garden.\n\n3)  Cornwall \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team head for rural Cornwall, where they create a spectacular contemporary garden for Chris Finney, a former serviceman who was awarded the George Cross in 2003. A space age-inspired area - complete with solar dome - will test Chris's knowledge as a novice gardener, and provide a stimulating haven for his young family.\n\n4)  Chessington \nAlan and the team head to Chessington to create a car-themed garden for hospital worker and automobile fan Alan Rendall. In July 2014, he managed to rescue his unconscious neighbour, Roy Whiteway, from his burning house, but was unable to save Dorothy, Roy's wife, as the fire was so intense. To recognise his bravery, Alan and the team surprise the whole Rendall family and turn their featureless plot into an automobile-inspired haven.\n\n5)  Hemel Hempstead \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team are in Hemel Hempstead, where they meet deaf couple Asif Iqbal and wife Sabina. The green-fingered experts attempt to turn a boring lawn and crumbling patio into a Bollywood dream garden with an outdoor kitchen for Asif, Sabina and their family.\n\n6)  Hull \nNurse Maggie Simkiss cares for end of life patients and treats their emotional well-being as well as their direct medical needs. To say thank you for her hard work, Alan Titchmarsh and his team of green-fingered experts arrive at her Hull home and help transform the unkempt garden into a grown-up Mediterranean hideaway.\n\n7)  Wiveliscombe, Somerset \nAlan and his team come to the aid of nonagenarian Roberta and her 86-year-old best friend and carer Enid, who live together in a retirement bungalow in Wiveliscombe, Somerset. Originally from Liverpool, the two plucky pensioners have helped each other out countless times throughout the course of their friendship, which has lasted seven decades. However, they now find themselves trapped in their home by a treacherous slope in their garden, so Alan plans to set them free by designing a future-proofed garden in a vintage style.\n\n8)  Dorset \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team are in Dorset creating an exciting garden for a young family. His idea for the Drakes is to give them an outdoor space that reflects terminally ill dad Andrew's love of the great outdoors and his passion for working with wood. He opts for a garden with a frontier-land theme that Andrew, wife Rachel and their young son Lucas can enjoy, creating a prairie-inspired back yard of big scale rustic wood structures, agricultural motifs with craftsmanship and the spirit of adventure at its core.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Love-Your-Garden-Series-5-Screen0.jpg&quot;
