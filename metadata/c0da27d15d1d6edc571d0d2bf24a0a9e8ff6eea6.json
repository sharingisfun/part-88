The opening sequence takes place in a house just put out for sale. In it, the discovery of what appears to be the dead family in the house, implicates the former chief-of-police to the plot. The now-retired chief-of-police, having made a lot of enemies in his past career, is recovering from a car crash in which his wife was killed and he himself barely survived.\n\n*Note: In French With Hard-Coded English Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0da27d15d1d6edc571d0d2bf24a0a9e8ff6eea6","amp;dn":"Witnesses+S01E04+subbed+720p+hdtv+x264-c4tv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0da27d15d1d6edc571d0d2bf24a0a9e8ff6eea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,218,39,209,93,29,110,220,87,29,13,43,242,74,10,158,143,246,238,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
