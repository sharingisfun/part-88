Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.\n\nThe objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:\n\nBomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n\nHostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion.\n\nVIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb23bda3e88a715c439645cd8a244ac6dbe9867","amp;dn":"Counter-Strike+1.6+%28Classic%29+%5BPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb23bda3e88a715c439645cd8a244ac6dbe9867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,178,59,218,62,136,167,21,196,57,100,92,216,162,68,172,109,190,152,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
