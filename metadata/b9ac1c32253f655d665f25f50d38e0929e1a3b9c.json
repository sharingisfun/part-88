The stories were all written by Steve Gerber in this batch.  Additional material such as a two-part story in Monsters Unleashed and an appearance in Rampaging Hulk are also included.  Read with maniacal glee as Gerber plots the apogee of the Man-Thing in the 1970's.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ac1c32253f655d665f25f50d38e0929e1a3b9c","amp;dn":"Essentials%3A+Man-Thing+%281975-1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ac1c32253f655d665f25f50d38e0929e1a3b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,172,28,50,37,63,101,93,102,95,37,245,13,56,224,146,158,26,59,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
