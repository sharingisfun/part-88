The film squeezes the entire Phantom Menace into the end sequence of Empire when Darth reveals himself to Luke. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a wild idea that totally works. \n\nOverall though, at an hour and 7, Phantom Menace only gets 40 minutes of runtime, and we get the most action pact and emotionally powerful elements of that film. On top of that, you get to see the most thrilling sequences in Empire.\n\nThis edit isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perfect. It was made in Windows movie maker or iMovie or some other free or cheap software, and some of the scene transitions are not smooth. The sound jumps at some, but not all of the cuts. The video was exported in low quality. But it is still highly watchable, and makes you wish someone had taken one more swipe at the script of Phantom Menace, which could have been a great film.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen a lot of fan edits, and I can never stomach The Phantom Menace, no matter how you edit it. Until now. Putting in scenes from Empire, one of the best films of all times, helps a lot. This edit also moves so quickly and smoothly, and retains all the best parts (while cutting out the immaculate conception and the mitochlorians) that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to say that this is the best version of Phantom IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen, and most clever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569f8bd4b9bf5688fe5620712f2131813f2f2ce9","amp;dn":"Fanedit+SW+-+Dark+Destiny+SD.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569f8bd4b9bf5688fe5620712f2131813f2f2ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,159,139,212,185,191,86,136,254,86,32,113,47,33,49,129,63,47,44,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
