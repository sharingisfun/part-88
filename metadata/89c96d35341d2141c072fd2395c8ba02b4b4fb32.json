Formed in 1993 in the Cleveland Warehouse District, the band is known for their avant-garde sound with includes influence from heavy metal, art rock and electro-industrial and their imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues. Mushroomhead has sold over 2 million units worldwide, and has made 8 studio albums and 15 music videos. During their inception, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band line-ups, with original members, lead singer Jeffrey Nothing, keyboardist Shmotz, and drummer Skinny, being the only consistent members.\n\nIn 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group's sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, masks, and pseudonyms. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band GWAR. &quot;We played our first show on a Saturday&quot; said the band's drummer, Skinny, in an article for MushroomheadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official website. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Three days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ our second show ever!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, Mushroomhead, with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released Superbuick. In 1999, Mushroomhead released M3, which the final album was self-financed and self-released by the band.\n\nIn 2001, Mushroomhead released a compilation album titled XX on the independent label Eclipse Records. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 months, the band signed with major label Universal Records and the compilation was remastered and re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including Ozzfest 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video &quot;Solitaire/Unraveling&quot;. Also in 2001, guitarist J.J. Righteous was replaced by one of the band's previous stage dancers &amp; then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of XIII, their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single &quot;Sun Doesn't Rise&quot; which was featured on MTV: Headbangers Ball and the Freddy vs Jason soundtrack. Also featuring the hidden track &quot;Crazy&quot;, a song originally by Seal. The album debuted at no. 40 on the Billboard Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide.\n\nAfter an extensive world tour, singer J Mann announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, Waylon. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Volume 1&quot;. Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band's rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.\n\nWhile on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with Megaforce Records, ensuring the new albums availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat - an interactive flash feature as a part of the band's official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a Mortal Kombat-style environment, with each member having a unique fatality.\n\nMushroomhead headlined with Dope, Nocturne, and New Orleans locals Invain on The Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by JÃƒÂ¤germeister at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.\n\nSavior Sorrow was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No. 45 on the Billboard 200 charts with sales exceeding 12,000. The band's label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour. As a result, SoundScan issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates. The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the Best Buy retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No. 30 spot than No. 73. Savior Sorrow's chart position was later officially adjusted to No. 50. &quot;Simple Survival&quot;, the pre-released single to Savior Sorrow, was placed at No. 39 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart one week after the release. Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.\n\nThe band has performed 3 shows on the Mayhem Festival tour, filling in for Bullet for My Valentine.\n\nLive footage was compiled into the band's second DVD, titled &quot;Volume 2&quot;. On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger's Ball for &quot;12 Hundred&quot; from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the &quot;Volume 2&quot; DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including &quot;12 Hundred&quot;, &quot;Simple Survival&quot;, &quot;Burn&quot;, the short video for &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Save Us&quot; and &quot;Embrace The Ending&quot;, video commentary and behind the scenes footage.\n\nTo support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with The Autumn Offering, XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.\n\nThey released Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No. 1 best selling metal album on iTunes. A new song, &quot;Your Soul Is Mine,&quot; appeared on the Saw VI Soundtrack. On October 1, 2010, a music video for &quot;Come On&quot; debuted on Headbangers Ball on MTV. The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network censors. On October 28, 2010, the band's founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, passed away of unknown reasons at the age of 41.\n\nIn October 2010, following the death of ex band-mate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other.\n\nOn Oct 5, 2010 The Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ) (Now called &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; ) used their hit single &quot;Come On&quot; as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that guitarist Gravy and bassist Pig Benis would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively.\n\nIn April 2012, Dave &quot;Gravy&quot; Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was &quot;kicked out of the band.&quot;\n\nIn May 2012, Daniel &quot;Lil Dan&quot; Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It is rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he didn't have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC.\n\nDrum tech &quot;Major Trauma&quot; (also known from (hed) pe) had taken over Lil Dan's custom percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3.\n\nAfter the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Dan's drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him &quot;Tall E&quot; in reference to Dan's nickname being &quot;Lil Dan&quot;.\n\nOn Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 &quot;Old School Show&quot;.\n\nIn September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeffrey Nothing that former Slipknot and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.\n\nTheir upcoming eighth album is the first to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Skinny described it as &quot;very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's going to go. For the old school fans there's a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it.&quot; The album will come out around early 2014.\n\nOn August 16, Jason Popson confirmed his return to the band on his personal Facebook.\n\nMushroomhead toured Australia for the first time as part of the Soundwave Festival 2014.\n\nOn February 14, 2014, Mushroomhead released the date and name of their new album which will be released May 13, 2014 and the name of the new album is The Righteous &amp; The Butterfly. This album marks the return of J Mann.\n\nOn April 15, 2014, Frontman Jeffrey Nothing released the bands first unofficial single &quot;Qwerty&quot; on YouTube from his personal Facebook account.
