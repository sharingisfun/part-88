The subject of the film is quite remarkableÃ¢â‚¬â€men who work life-threatening jobsÃ¢â‚¬â€and as the settings jump from Java to China, Nigeria to the Ukraine, so does the music. Steaming sulphur mines, the bloodbaths of a brutal slaughterhouseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦these are just a few of the scenes that are evoked in this unique score that blends dynamic rhythms with ambient soundscapes. \n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista: Percussion\nShanir Ezra Blumenkranz: Bass\nIkue Mori: Electronics\nJamie Saft: Electric Piano, Guitar\nJohn Zorn: Organ, Gamelan \n\n    &quot;Gadani Slipway&quot; - 9:01\n    &quot;Juju&quot; - 6:14\n    &quot;Sulphur Mining&quot; - 6:29\n    &quot;Horn Carrier&quot; - 3:16\n    &quot;Atmosphere&quot; - 2:13\n    &quot;The Miners&quot; - 3:05\n    &quot;Steel Factory&quot; - 6:01\n    &quot;Work Trance&quot; - 3:20\n    &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; - 2:51\n    &quot;Dark Caves&quot; - 3:17\n    &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; - 9:09\n    &quot;Guitar Juju&quot; - 6:20\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91297ef7a95152b65c5ce9eaf56f4bd8b0b26c65","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+16+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91297ef7a95152b65c5ce9eaf56f4bd8b0b26c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,41,126,247,169,81,82,182,92,92,233,234,245,111,75,216,176,178,108,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
