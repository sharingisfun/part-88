Keith offers up a gay beach story, we look at some pics and video from the NY studio, see Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rat on the streetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ footage, Ant talks about the movie he watched called Ã¢â‚¬Å“True Story,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reminisces about Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Real World,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the callers chime in. We watch the trailer for &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead,&quot; Anthony discusses the roast of Big Jay, bums and de Blasio, we watch a meeting room tussle and a heated immigration chat on The Five, and Ant talks about Geraldo Rivera coming up in the media and we see a few throwback clips of him. We hear about a bar mitzvah blowjob lady, go through viewer mail, and the show wraps up getting completely sidetracked by ThirtyEightDD.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfcbc79b925ab2348a204e03d92320a8340275fb","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-07-14+Colin+Quinn+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfcbc79b925ab2348a204e03d92320a8340275fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,203,199,155,146,90,178,52,138,32,78,3,217,35,32,168,52,2,117,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
