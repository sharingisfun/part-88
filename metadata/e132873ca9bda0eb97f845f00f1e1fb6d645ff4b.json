In total there were 471 SD9s built by Electro-Motive between 1954 and 1959 and was the immediate successor of the very similar, 1,500hp SD7, introduced in 1952. \n\nIn basic terms, the SD9 was a lengthened GP9 with six axles rather than the GP9Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s four axles. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stood for Ã¢â‚¬ËœSpecial DutyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and was reflective of the unitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extra lugging ability and lighter axle loadings that were achievable from using a C-C rather than a B-B wheel arrangement. The SD9s were primarily based from Provo and used as heavy yard switchers and for local and transfer freight services in the Provo, Salt Lake City and Ogden regions. \n\nDenver &amp; Rio Grande owned a total of 10 SD9s as well as five of the earlier SD7s, with all units originally wearing the distinctive traditional black and orange livery with zebra stripe ends, featuring small Ã¢â‚¬ËœRio GrandeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lettering on the sides of the hoods. \n\nThe EMD SD9 for Train Simulator is available in Denver &amp; Rio Grande livery and features advanced braking controls scripted specifically for the Soldier Summit route. Also included are mill gondolas as freight traffic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e132873ca9bda0eb97f845f00f1e1fb6d645ff4b","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015++DTG+D%26amp%3BRGW+SD9+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e132873ca9bda0eb97f845f00f1e1fb6d645ff4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,50,135,60,169,189,160,235,151,248,69,240,15,30,31,182,214,69,255,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
