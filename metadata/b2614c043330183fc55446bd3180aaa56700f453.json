This fourth edition has been completely revised and focuses on the dynamism and diversity of contemporary Africa. The volume emphasizes contemporary cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€œcivil and social issues, art, religion, and the political sceneÃ¢â‚¬â€œand provides an overview of significant themes that bear on Africa's place in the world. Historically grounded, Africa provides a comprehensive view of the ways that African women and men have constructed their lives and engaged in collective activities at the local, national, and global levels.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 376 pages\nPublisher: Indiana University Press; Fourth Edition edition (May 5, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0253012929\nISBN-13: 978-0253012920\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2614c043330183fc55446bd3180aaa56700f453","amp;dn":"Africa%2C+Fourth+Edition+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2614c043330183fc55446bd3180aaa56700f453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,97,76,4,51,48,24,63,197,84,70,189,49,128,170,165,103,0,244,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
