Nelson, Scott E. Olitsky\nThis clinically oriented volume reviews the signs, symptoms and treament of common ocular diseases and disorders in infants and children. Ocular disorders are of major significance as they often provide clues to the presence, not only of systemic diseases, but also of other congenital malformations. By means of concise text supported by a wealth of colour illustrations the authors' aim is to enable the reader to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis, to ensure early treatment which may ultimately prevent the occurrence of further disease. This book is useful for all those who care for affected children, including paediatricians, primary care and emergency physicians, trainee ophthalmologists, optometrists and medical students..\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3e488fe0f9c98c61df956f5cd7f4e28a55a7d9","amp;dn":"A+Color+Handbook+Pediatric+Clinical+Ophthalmology%2C+2012+%5BPDF%5D%5BDr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3e488fe0f9c98c61df956f5cd7f4e28a55a7d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,62,72,143,224,249,201,140,97,223,149,111,92,215,244,226,138,85,167,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
