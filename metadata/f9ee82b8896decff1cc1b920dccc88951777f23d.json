Fabulous research and wonderful use of artwork (paintings) to show the historical fashions by date. It is the most comprehensive bible of fashion history in print today. Can't recommend it more highly. My Costume Design professor wants all her design students to invest in this book, as it is invaluable in researching historical dress. She's owned it for over a decade and uses it in the classroom with her students for practically every project","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ee82b8896decff1cc1b920dccc88951777f23d","amp;dn":"20000+Years+of+Fashion+-+The+History+of+Costume+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ee82b8896decff1cc1b920dccc88951777f23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,238,130,184,137,109,236,255,28,193,185,32,220,204,136,149,23,119,242,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
