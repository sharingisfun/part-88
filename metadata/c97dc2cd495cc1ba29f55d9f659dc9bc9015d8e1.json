It can parse and evaluate textual numeric expressions with chemical element symbols or without them. The program includes functions for statistical analysis, solving the quadratic equation and more. All of the calculations can be print or save and recalls again. The calculator also provides a list of common physical constants and performs various conversions between English and metric units","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c97dc2cd495cc1ba29f55d9f659dc9bc9015d8e1","amp;dn":"Chemistry+Assistant+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c97dc2cd495cc1ba29f55d9f659dc9bc9015d8e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,125,194,205,73,92,193,186,41,245,93,159,101,157,201,188,144,21,216,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
