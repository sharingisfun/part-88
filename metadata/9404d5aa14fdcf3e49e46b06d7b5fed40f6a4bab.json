Manahan, &quot;Environmental Science and Technology: A Sustainable Approach to Green Science and Technology, Second Edition&quot;\n\n2006 | ISBN-10: 0849395127 | 647 pages | PDF | 43 MB\n\nFormally established by the EPA nearly 15 years ago, the concept of green chemistry is beginning to come of age. Although several books cover green chemistry and chemical engineering, none of them transfer green principles to science and technology in general and their impact on the future. Defining industrial ecology, Environmental Science and Technology: A Sustainable Approach to Green Science and Technology provides a general overview of green science and technology and their essential role in ensuring environmental sustainability.\n\nWritten by a leading expert, the book provides the essential background for understanding green science and technology and how they relate to sustainability. In addition to the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere traditionally covered in environmental science books, this book is unique in recognizing the anthrosphere as a distinct sphere of the environment. The author explains how the anthrosphere can be designed and operated in a manner that does not degrade environmental quality and, in most favorable circumstances, may even enhance it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9404d5aa14fdcf3e49e46b06d7b5fed40f6a4bab","amp;dn":"Environmental+Science+and+Technology%3A+A+Sustainable+Approach+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9404d5aa14fdcf3e49e46b06d7b5fed40f6a4bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,4,213,170,20,253,207,62,73,228,107,6,215,181,254,212,15,106,75,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
