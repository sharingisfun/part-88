Though rich, famous &amp; privy to sights and experiences most people can't imagine, something's missing - A direction. A purpose. A spark-\n\nWriter Karl Kesel and future superstar artist Skottie Young reignite that spark and redefine the FF's youngest, most impetuous member. Now more fire-like than ever, Johnny is capable of great warmth, and even greater fury.
