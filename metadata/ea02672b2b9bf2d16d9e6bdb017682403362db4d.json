While on the lam he befriends a young street urchin (Vittorio Manunta) who suspects the police are after him for stealing milk from the same shop owner. The police pursue the two lost souls through the war-torn streets and buildings of an Italian port city. This neorealist film noir was based on a story by novelist NoÃƒÂ«l Calef\n\nCAST:- \nPaul Muni\nJoan Lorring\nVittorio Manunta\nLuisa Rossi \nAldo Silvani\nArnoldo FoÃƒÂ \nAlfredo Varelli \nHÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©na Manson\nFausta Mazzucchelli \nCesare Trapani\nEnrico Glori \nFranco Balducci \nLeonardo Scavino\nLinda Sini \nGiulio Marchetti \n\nSYNOPSIS:- Stranger on the Prowl (1952)\nA homeless man is wandering around an Italian port city with a pistol. He is looking to sell it to get himself money for passage on a boat leaving at midnight. The junk man won't take the gun, and the junk man's friend who deals in black market goods is only willing to offer the homeless man a pittance. The homeless man gets riled up and nearly pulls the trigger on the low-balling cheat. He restrains himself, though, and sticks the pistol back in his pocket before going on his way.\n\nThe homeless man, whose name we never learn, is played by Paul Muni (Scarface, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang). For a large chunk of 1952's Stranger on the Prowl, Muni's performance as this homeless man is centered on his face. The character does speak -- with an American accent that sounds out of place amidst all the Italians in the cast -- but all of the character's anguish, fatigue, and anger is constantly being communicated by Muni's extremely expressive eyes. (And, even though his character is unkempt and unshaven, it has to be said that Muni looks awfully good for a fellow in his mid-50s.) One could get the sense that maybe the character is trying to divert energy away from his body. That might seem like a bit of a logical leap, but there are a few isolated moments where Muni's character unleashes his considerable physical strength -- and mostly the results are not good.\n\nThe first big turning point of the story arrives when the famished homeless man walks into a cheese shop. He grabs a wheel of cheese from the window and just starts eating. The woman who owns the shop begins yelling at him. He puts his arm around her head to stop her from screaming and ends up accidentally breaking her neck. A woman at a shop across the way sees the murder and starts yelling for the police. As the homeless man flees, a young boy called Giacomo (Vittorio Manunta), who has just shoplifted some milk from the cheese shop mistakenly believes the cops are being called on him. Both Giacomo and the homeless man end up fleeing and hiding together, with Muni's character never taking a moment to set the kid straight about who the real fugitive is.\n\nEven though the film was directed by an American, the blacklisted Joseph Losey (The Servant), the Italian setting obviously inspired Losey to emulate the neorealist style, with a lot of location shooting and a selection of main characters who are all suffering in abject poverty. It's not a completely successful example of the form. Certain moments drift too far into over-the-top melodrama, while other scenes are so &quot;realistic&quot; that they're just dull.\n\nThe final thirty minutes of the film, where Muni's character and Giacomo hole up in the apartment of a young woman named Angela (Joan Lorring), sees the movie shift stylistically more toward film noir. It's a good move, giving the film greater dramatic immediacy. Muni's character has been shot in the arm. The police have surrounded the neighborhood and are beginning to systematically check all the buildings. Muni's character is given a chance in this final passage to show his best and worst sides, eloquently expressing his thwarted desires to Giacomo but then lashing out violently at Angela when she tries to escape.\n\nThe film seems to side with Muni's character, seeing some justification in his pain and anger. To the film's credit, it does not shy away from showing the ugliness that can come when these feelings are mismanaged. And to his credit, Muni does not allow his character to be turned into a mere monster. His &quot;Stranger&quot; has simple motivations but he is shown to have a complex intellect and emotions. Therefore, even though the plot is undercooked and thematically the film is a little muddled, Stranger on the Prowl stands as a better-than-decent acting showcase for Paul Muni.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 7377 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 82 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea02672b2b9bf2d16d9e6bdb017682403362db4d","amp;dn":"Stranger+on+the+Prowl+%281952%29+DVD5+Uncompressed+-+Paul+Muni%2C+Joan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea02672b2b9bf2d16d9e6bdb017682403362db4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,2,103,43,43,155,242,209,109,158,107,219,1,118,130,64,51,98,219,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
