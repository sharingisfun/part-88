The show was held in Berlin on 21 July 1990, to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall eight months earlier. A live album of the concert was released 21 August 1990. \n\nThe concert was staged on vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate, a location that was part of the former &quot;no man's land&quot; of the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe show had a sell-out crowd of over 350,000 people, and right before the performance started the gates were opened which enabled at least another 100,000 people to watch. \n\nThe event was produced and cast by British impresario and producer Tony Hollingsworth. It was staged partly at Waters' expense. \n\nThe production was designed by Mark Fisher and Jonathan Park. The stage design featured a 550-foot-long (170 m) and 82-foot-high (25 m) wall. Most of the wall was built before the show and the rest was built progressively through the first part of the show. The wall was then knocked down at the end of the show.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks out to PSYCHO for DVD rip. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVideo quality not that great but as good as source. Audio outstanding though which really matters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729a2f4ea1509a6198dca6bef4ab2f2d23a2ac22","amp;dn":"The+Wall+-+Live+in+Berlin+%281990%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729a2f4ea1509a6198dca6bef4ab2f2d23a2ac22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,154,47,78,161,80,154,97,152,220,166,190,244,171,47,45,35,162,172,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
