This book is a reference for all knitting techniques, beginning with the basics of how to knit. A large section of the book is devoted to showing different stitch patterns, arranged in style categories for easy reference. Special knitting topics will be explored in depth: cables, intarsia, entrelac, Fair Isle knitting, and lace knitting. A section will discuss yarns: fibers, how they are spun, gauge, and how to choose.\n\n\nBy Margaret Hubert\nPublished by Creative Publishing in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe0e25ccb74c34e1db8ceeeba154c6b9fc35f979","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Photo+Guide+to+Knitting%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe0e25ccb74c34e1db8ceeeba154c6b9fc35f979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,14,37,204,183,76,52,225,219,140,238,235,161,84,198,185,252,53,249,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
