Scary good.\n\nThe vector calculus blazing through her head lets her smash through armed men twice her size and dodge every bullet in a gunfight. She can take any job for the right price and shoot anyone who gets in her way.\n\nAs far as she knows, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only person around with a superpower . . . but then Cas discovers someone with a power even more dangerous than her own. Someone who can reach directly into peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minds and twist their brains into Moebius strips. Someone intent on becoming the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s puppet master.\n\nSomeone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already warped CasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts once before, with her none the wiser.\n\nCas should run. Going up against a psychic with a god complex isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly a rational move, and saving the world from a power-hungry telepath isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t her responsibility. But she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to let anyone get away with violating her brain -- and besides, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a small arsenal and some deadly mathematics on her side. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one problem . . .\n\nShe doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know which of her thoughts are her own anymore.\n\n(For more information see www.slhuang.com)\n\nHalf Life\nRussell's Attic, Book 2, by SL Huang.  \n\nFormats: MOBI, EPUB, PDF. \nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nDescription:\n\nCas Russell is back Ã¢â‚¬â€ and so is her deadly supermath. \n\nCas may be an antisocial mercenary who uses her instant calculating skills to mow down enemies, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying hard to build up a handful of morals. So when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hired by an anguished father to rescue his kid from an evil tech conglomerate, it seems like the perfect job to use for ethics practice. \n\nThen she finds her clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter . . . who is a robot. \n\nThe researchers who own the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢bot will stop at nothing to get it back, but the kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just real enough for Cas to want to protect her Ã¢â‚¬â€ even though she knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s risking everything for a collection of metal and wires. But when the case blows up in her face, it plunges Cas into the crossfire of a massive, decades-long corporate espionage war. \n\nCas knows logically that she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t saving a child. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stealing a piece of technology, one expensive and high-stakes enough that spiriting it away is going to get innocent people killed. But she has a distraught father on one hand and a robot programmed to act like a distraught daughter on the other, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been able to sit by when a kid is in trouble Ã¢â‚¬â€ even a fake one. \n\nScrew morals and ethics. All Cas wants to do is save one little girl.\n\nFor more information see www.slhuang.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5668b6ebfd124aefc9eea95f694adf98a02498d1","amp;dn":"Russell%27s+Attic+1-2%2C+by+SL+Huang+%28Zero+Sum+Game%2C+Half+Life%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5668b6ebfd124aefc9eea95f694adf98a02498d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,104,182,235,253,18,74,239,201,238,169,95,105,74,223,152,160,36,152,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
