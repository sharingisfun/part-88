Most of these songs were written for this project, some even improvised on the spot as in the case of the Edie Brickell, Wasserman, Garcia cuts. Elvis Costello, along with Marc Ribot, are great. There are some bass instrumentals but the best is &quot;Fantasy Is Reality&quot; written by Sam Philips and Brian Wilson and sung by his daughter Carnie.\n\n\nTrack List:\n1. Fantasy Is Reality/ Bells Of Madness (Ft. Brian Wilson / Carnie Wilson)\n2. Put Your Big Toe In The Milk Of Human Kindness (Ft. Elvis Costello / Marc Ribot)\n3. White-Wheeled Limousine (Ft. Bruce Hornsby / Branford Marsalis)\n4. Country\n5. Zillionaire (Ft. Edie Brickell / Jerry Garcia)\n6. Dustin' Off The Bass (Ft. Willie Dixon / Al Duncan)\n7. Easy Answers (Ft.
