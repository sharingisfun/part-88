Wounded, one of the escapees flees through black-shadowed streets to the handiest refuge: with former cellmate Steve Lacey. Steve is paroled, with a new life and lovely wife, and can't afford to be caught associating with old cronies. But homicide detective Sims wants to use Steve to help him catch the other 2 escapees, who in turn extort his help in a bank job.\n\nMy Notes\n\n  Years ago I added &quot;Crime Wave&quot;  to the file shares with the commentary track only.  That was _then_  (as Ellroy used as the theme of &quot;LAPD '53.&quot;)   _Now_ I have better tools for encoding.    That commentary by James Ellroy with film historian Eddie Muller ranks with Thom Andersen's  &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself&quot; which is well worth seeking out.\n  \n  Here you have &quot;Crime Wave&quot;   with original soundtrack, the optional commentary track by James Ellroy,  English and French Subtitles.  Use your VLC player to get the te streams.  Note:  you must start the film from the beginning and select one stream.  English and French subs are for the film only.\n\n  &quot;LAPD '53,&quot;  a recent non-fiction book by Ellroy contains frequent references to &quot;Crime Wave.&quot;  &quot;LAPD '53&quot; is a collection of crime scene &quot;fotos&quot; from the LAPD history museum.  Highy recommended reading for fans of of James Ellroy.  \n\n   If your library does not have these selections of book and film, request that they get them.\n\n\nNotes written July 25th,  2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57275d31b9be89fae3caea4325c570489fbca5c","amp;dn":"Crime+Wave+%281954%29+includes+James+Ellroy+Commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57275d31b9be89fae3caea4325c570489fbca5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,114,117,211,27,155,232,159,174,60,174,164,50,92,87,4,137,251,202,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
