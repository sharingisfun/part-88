Eight models featuring movable parts are presented and explained: loader, dozer, dozer loader, excavator, grader, skidder, grapple skidder, and backhoe. Complete assembly drawings for each of the eight toys make these projects simple and fun for adults to create. Drawings show the entire process, from building the wheelbase to adding the buckets. Full-size cutting templates can be used to make the projects exactly as they are shown or altered to create new vehicles. A parts list makes it easy for the hobbyist to gather all the materials needed for construction and assembly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8e9d8db535191e4969b79c7cc10258034da838","amp;dn":"Realistic+Construction+Models+You+Can+Make","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8e9d8db535191e4969b79c7cc10258034da838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,142,157,141,181,53,25,30,73,105,183,156,124,193,2,88,3,77,168,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
