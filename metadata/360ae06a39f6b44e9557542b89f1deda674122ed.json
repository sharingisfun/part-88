They insist on traveling by ship and book passage on the Lady Anne, an old ship that is not recommended by the travel agent but is leaving quite soon. When they arrive at the port terminal another passenger, McKenzie, says they've made a mistake and they shouldn't board. Another, Burgess, tries to warn them off as well and he and McKenzie offer them $10,000 to leave immediately. They find that all of the passengers are quite elderly but have a good deal of wisdom to dispense. They are more than a little taken aback when the captain puts them off the ship. They are rescued, but as for the Lady Anne.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:360ae06a39f6b44e9557542b89f1deda674122ed","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Passage+On+The+Lady+Anne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"360ae06a39f6b44e9557542b89f1deda674122ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,10,224,106,57,246,180,78,149,87,84,43,137,241,222,218,103,65,34,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
