Or canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t collect it where you need it. Upon these principles, wearable technology was born. And although smart watches and fitness trackers have become almost ubiquitous, with in-body sensors on the horizon, the future applications of wearable computers hold so much more. A trusted reference for almost 15 years, Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality goes beyond smart clothing to explore user interface design issues specific to wearable tech and areas in which it can be applied.\n\nUpon its initial publication, the first edition almost instantly became a trusted reference, setting the stage for the coming decade, in which the explosion in research and applications of wearable computers and augmented reality occurred. Written by expert researchers and teachers, each chapter in the second edition has been revised and updated to reflect advances in the field and provide fundamental knowledge on each topic, solidifying the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation as a valuable technical resource as well as a textbook for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41a76f2ffc4d68cf27383d8228dfdbf392b1cd7","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Wearable+Computers+and+Augmented+Reality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41a76f2ffc4d68cf27383d8228dfdbf392b1cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,26,118,242,255,196,214,140,242,115,131,216,34,141,253,191,57,43,28,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
