The IDE provides smart code completion, syntax highlighting, extended code formatting configuration, on-the-fly error checking, code folding, supports language mixtures and more.\n\nLanguage Features Support\nThe latest PHP 5.6 is fully supported including exponentiation, variadic functions, argument unpacking, and more. PHP 5.5, 5.4 &amp; 5.3 are supported as well. With all the language features in place, there is no reason not to update your project to the latest PHP version. There is also a partial support for upcoming PHP 7.\n\nCode Completion\nAutomatic code completion (invoked on typing) finalizes classes, methods, variable names, and PHP keywords, plus commonly used names for fields and variables depending on their type. Code completion also supports array indexes in PHP code.\n\nPHPDoc Support\nPhpStorm editor respects PHPDoc in your code and provides appropriate code completion suggestions based on annotations. When you edit PHPDoc for your code, variable names and types are auto-completed from the corresponding code blocks. PHP code refactorings also consider PHPDocs to keep them up to date.\n\n\nPHP Refactoring\nThe Rename and Move refactorings work for files, functions, constants, classes, properties, methods, parameters, and local and global variables. Make global project changes easily and safely. Local changes are made instantly in-place.\n\nThe following refactorings are also available: Extract Variable / Constant / Field / Method / Interface, Inline variable, Push members Up / Pull members Down, Change signature, Move class to another namespace, Move static member.\n\nCode Formatting\nCode formatter with code style configuration and other features help you write neat code that's easy to support. PhpStorm contains built-in PSR1/PSR2, Symfony2, Zend, Drupal &amp; other standards compliant code formatting.\n\nCode (Re)arranger\nCode (re)arranger is a powerful tool to control the structure of your existing and generated code. For example, you can specify methods to be ordered after fields or keep dependent methods together.\n\nFrameworks Support\nThe existing support of template engines and command-line tools is boosted with a more high-level feature: an MVC view for Symfony2 &amp; Yii frameworks.\n\nPlugins are also available bringing various framework-specific features, such as code completion, navigation, type inference and other IDE best practices for various PHP frameworks (Symfony, Drupal, Magento, etc.).\n\nGet more information in PhpStorm plugin repository\n\n\n\nCode Quality Analysis\n\nHundreds of code inspections verify your code as you type and inspect the whole project for possible errors or code smells.\n\nQuick-fixes for most inspections make it easy to fix or improve the code instantly. Alt+Enter shows appropriate options for each inspection.\n\n\nPHP Code Sniffer &amp; Mess Detector\nCheck your code on the fly with PHP Code Sniffer (phpcs) and PHP Mess Detector (phpmd), just by opening a PHP file. The check is triggered every time you change something in the file, so it's extremely easy to fix problems reported by PHP Code Sniffer &amp; PHP Mess Detector.\n\nSmart Duplicated Code Detector\nAdded for all major supported languages including PHP, HTML and CSS. Use Code | Locate Duplicates to start your quest against copy/paste coding. You'll be presented with a list of candidates for refactoring Ã¢â‚¬â€ and with the help of refactorings it's easy to keep your code DRY.\n\nCallback References\nCode editor understands callback references within string literals, and provides advanced assistance such as usages search and rename refactoring.\n\nPhar Packages\nPhpStorm transparently recognises Phar-packaged code.\n\n\n\nTwig, Blade &amp; Smarty Templates\nUse the Twig, Blade or Smarty template engine to take advantage of productivity features when working with template files: configurable syntax highlighting for different constructs; syntax errors highlighting; functions and attributes completion; automatic insertion of paired braces, quotes and closing tags; and more.\n\nEfficient Project Analysis and Navigation\nIts thorough source code analysis allows PhpStorm to provide sophisticated code completion even for unannotated code, for example when the function return type is deducted from its body and return statements or class property types (and declarations) are extracted from the constructor code.\n\nFile structure view and class, method and call hierarchy views allow for faster code review and navigation.\n\n\n=================================================\n\nStep 1: Install PhpStorm 9.0\nStep 2: Run Keygen, select PhpStorm, generate and copy license key\nStep 3: Run PhpStorm 9.0 and paste generated license key into activation window","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1b0ea5bead9590943bd4e302141140a0d705ca","amp;dn":"JetBrains+PhpStorm+9.0+build+141.1912+%5BKeyGen+Incl.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1b0ea5bead9590943bd4e302141140a0d705ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,27,14,165,190,173,149,144,148,59,212,227,2,20,17,64,160,215,5,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
