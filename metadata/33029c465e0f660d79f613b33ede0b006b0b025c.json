This disc collects acoustic and electric takes which highlight wolf's Delta Blues origins and the evolution of his singular voice.  &quot;Cadillac Daddy&quot; (Mr. Highway Man) sounds very similar to his later innovations in Chicago Blues.  Chess Records originally bought these sides from Phillips and invited Wolf to Chicago.  Most bluesmen during this time exclusively recorded singles and contracts for full albums were still years off for the artists.  This collection of singles therefore represents the first album produced by Howlin' Wolf.
