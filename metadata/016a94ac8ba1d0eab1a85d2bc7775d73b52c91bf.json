Now, three years on, her marriage crushed by grief and the uncertainty around CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate, Carrie keeps herself distracted by running a local gift shop. Persuaded by her mother to visit a medium, Carrie is initially sceptical, but is blown away when he appears to reveal something about CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance; something that nobody could ever have known except herself.\n\nSingle mum, Molly, is worried about her young son, Max. Naturally a sensitive child, Max has been having more of his little Ã¢â‚¬ËœaccidentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at school and has recently starting talking again to his imaginary friend.\n\nReluctant to tell his teachers, Molly knows that MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems stem from his very real anxieties about his father Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a violent and unstable man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who they are now in hiding from.\n\nCarrie is desperate to learn the truth about CharlieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance and Molly is will do anything to protect Max from danger. Little do the women know that their worlds are about to converge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and both of them will have to face the thing they fear the most. But will the truth destroy them or will love be their saviour?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016a94ac8ba1d0eab1a85d2bc7775d73b52c91bf","amp;dn":"Someone+to+Watch+Over+Me+by+Madeleine+Reiss+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016a94ac8ba1d0eab1a85d2bc7775d73b52c91bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,106,148,172,139,161,208,234,177,168,93,43,199,119,93,115,181,44,145,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
