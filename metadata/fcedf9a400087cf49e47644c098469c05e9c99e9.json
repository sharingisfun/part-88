The Constructivist style was resurrected in the 1980s and is still popular, striking, and fairly easy to imitate today. In this Type Project, Nigel invokes the style and the spirit of the Constructivist movement in an evocative poster design. He shows how to choose historically appropriate typefaces (square, solid, and sans serif) and use Illustrator's tools to align, space, and rotate your type. Plus, learn how to use a simple illustration to enhance the underlying message and add texture to your design.\n\nWant more inspiration?
