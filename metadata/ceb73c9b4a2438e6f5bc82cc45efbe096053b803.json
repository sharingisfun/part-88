Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nSAY WHAT?\n\nPOLITICAL SPEECH: I long for the day when a politician runs a campaign ad that speaks the truth... Instead, politicians use words like this. Here's what they really mean:\n\nEvery politician obsesses over what he should say when he speaks. Which words will move people? &quot;What will get people to like me?&quot; Frank Luntz arranges focus groups that help decipher what these words are. He tells Stossel how it works.\n\nCLINTON SCANDAL MANUAL: The Clintons have been at the center of a lot of scandals (sex with interns, the Whitewater scandal, deaths in Benghazi, their dubious charity, and most recently, violation of State Department email rules.) Yet, they've largely gone unpunished. The Clintons must have a Scandal Manual that helps them escape punishment: Lie or deny scandal allegations, parse the truth, and confuse the press.\n\nPOLITICANS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS: Political gaffes can often make or break a politician's campaign: Senator George Allen never recovered after he referred to a cameraman with the racial term &quot;Macaca.&quot; I discuss the repercussions of some famous gaffes with comedian Tom Shillue.\n\nMY TAKE: Orwell wrote, &quot;Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable. They give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.&quot; It's another reminder of why we ought to keep government's powers limited.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Stossel.2015.05.08.Say.What.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 349 MiB\nDuration : 41mn 7s\nOverall bit rate : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 41mn 6s\nBit rate : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.714\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.154\nStream size : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 41mn 7s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceb73c9b4a2438e6f5bc82cc45efbe096053b803","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.05.08.Say.What.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceb73c9b4a2438e6f5bc82cc45efbe096053b803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,183,60,155,74,36,56,230,245,188,130,204,69,239,190,9,96,83,184,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
