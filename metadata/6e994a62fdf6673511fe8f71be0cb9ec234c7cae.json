Ten years after his father Genichirou was killed battling the evil Rebi Ra, teen-aged Kyoya Izayoi is called to stop Rebi from releasing demons from hell onto the Earth. Demon City borrows heavily from Star Wars: Ag'ni Rai, Genichirou's teacher, tells Kyoya that he must learn to harness the web of spiritual energy that flows among living things. This minimal training, plus his father's sword and the love of beautiful Sayaka enable Kyoya to destroy Rebi Ra. The film is oddly paced, with a long build-up to a disappointing climax, problems that are exacerbated by the very stiff vocal performances. Kawajiri uses color with his accustomed skill, especially in the monochromatic opening duel, but Demon City hardly ranks among his important works\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : High@L4\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 16 frames\nFormat settings, GOP : M=1, N=21\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nBit rate : 1 882 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 3:2\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 23.810 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 24.390 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.227\nStream size : 1.04 GiB (90%)\nWriting library : x264 core 61\n\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : ac-3\nDuration : 1h 19mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 109 MiB (9%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e994a62fdf6673511fe8f71be0cb9ec234c7cae","amp;dn":"Demon+City+Shinjuku+%281988%29+%28HQ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e994a62fdf6673511fe8f71be0cb9ec234c7cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,153,74,98,253,246,103,53,17,254,143,113,190,12,185,236,35,76,124,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
