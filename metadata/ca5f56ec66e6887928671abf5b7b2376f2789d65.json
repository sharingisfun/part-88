Ã¢â‚¬Å“Food as medicineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a powerfully healing way to eat and was embraced by nutritionist Jennifer Adler as she recovered from a malnourÃ‚Â­ished childhood and adolescence. Part power-foods cookbook, part handbook for healthy living and eating, and part memoir, Passionate Nutrition provides digestible information, tips, and techniques for how to find your way to optimal health. She focuses on abundant eatÃ‚Â­ing (as opposed to restrictive eating), and explores what she calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“the healthy trinityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€digestion, balance, and whole foods. Adler guides and encourages readers to shift their diet to achieve this desirable balÃ‚Â­ance, introduces power foods we should all eat, and provides healthy ways to lose weight, along with simple recipes to optimize health. With her personal story interwoven, readers will be inspired to embrace the healthy power of food","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5f56ec66e6887928671abf5b7b2376f2789d65","amp;dn":"Passionate+Nutrition%3A+A+Guide+to+Using+Food+as+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5f56ec66e6887928671abf5b7b2376f2789d65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,95,86,236,102,230,136,121,40,103,26,191,91,123,35,118,242,120,157,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
