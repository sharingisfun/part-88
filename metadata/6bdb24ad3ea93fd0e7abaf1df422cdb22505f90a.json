Now, Varley takes another leap into the great unknown with Mammoth... \n\nIn a barren province of Canada, a mammoth hunter has made the discovery of a lifetime: an intact frozen wooly mammoth. But what he finds during the painstaking process of excavating the huge creature boggles the mind. Huddled next to the mammoth is the mummified body of a Stone Age man around 12,000 years old. And he is wearing a wristwatch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdb24ad3ea93fd0e7abaf1df422cdb22505f90a","amp;dn":"Mammoth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdb24ad3ea93fd0e7abaf1df422cdb22505f90a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,219,36,173,62,169,63,208,231,171,175,29,244,34,205,178,37,5,249,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
