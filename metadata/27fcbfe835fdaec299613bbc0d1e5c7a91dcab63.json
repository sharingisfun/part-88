But the two friends quickly shun their already-meager responsibilities for the day when they insinuate themselves into the planned Fort Tilden afternoon of a pair of cute guys they met at a party. As the two young women board their bicycles and embark on a wildly complicated trek to the beach, they quickly realize that, akin to their confusing, transitioning lives, they neither know where theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going nor how they plan to get there.\n\nDirector: Sarah-Violet Bliss, Charles Rogers\n\nWriters: Sarah-Violet Bliss, Charles Rogers\n\nActors: Bridey Elliott, Clare McNulty, Neil Casey, Alysia Reiner, Griffin Newman, Jeffrey Scaperrotta\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 35 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fcbfe835fdaec299613bbc0d1e5c7a91dcab63","amp;dn":"Fort+Tilden.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fcbfe835fdaec299613bbc0d1e5c7a91dcab63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,252,191,232,53,253,174,194,153,97,59,188,13,30,92,122,145,220,171,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
