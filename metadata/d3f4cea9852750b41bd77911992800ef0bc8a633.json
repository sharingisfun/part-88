The authors demonstrate the advantages of the methods presented for control and optimization through extensive simulations.\n\nIncluded in the work are new techniques for feedback controller design and optimization of multiscale process systems that are not included in other books. The book also contains a rich collection of new research topics and references to significant recent work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f4cea9852750b41bd77911992800ef0bc8a633","amp;dn":"Control+and+Optimization+of+Multiscale+Process+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f4cea9852750b41bd77911992800ef0bc8a633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,244,206,169,133,39,80,180,27,215,121,17,153,40,0,239,11,200,166,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
