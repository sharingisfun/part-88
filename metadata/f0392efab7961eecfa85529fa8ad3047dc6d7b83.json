It  contains  approximately 100  sections,  each describing  a\ndifferent  molecule and  typically what  it does,  how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  made, and\nwhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  so  interesting  about  it. Examples  include  capsaicin  (the\nmolecule responsible for the spicy  heat of chillis), DEET (the insect\nrepellent), Kevlar  Ã‚Â® (the  material for bullet-proof  vests), taurine\n(the  stimulant  in  Red  Bull), vanillin  (the  flavor  of  vanilla),\nnitroglycerine (the explosive in dynamite), and many others.\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\nSimon Cotton is an honorary senior lecturer in the School of Chemistry\nat the University  of Birmingham, UK. Dr. Cotton obtained  his BSc and\nPhD at Imperial College London.  His research focuses on the chemistry\nof  transition  metals,  particularly  iron and  cobalt,  as  well  as\nscandium and the lanthanides.\n\nDr. Cotton has published various peer-reviewed articles and five books\non the  chemistry of  the d-  and f-block elements.  He has  written a\ncolumn  titled &quot;Soundbite  Molecules&quot;  for the  magazine Education  in\nChemistry, and dozens  of &quot;Chemistry in its Element&quot;  podcasts for the\nRSCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chemistry World website. In 2005  he shared the Royal Society of\nChemistry Schools Education Award.\n\nHis book Every Molecule Tells a Story is also published by CRC Press.\n\n\nPaul May is  a professor of physical chemistry  at Bristol University,\nwhere he obtained his PhD. He  leads a research group that studies the\nfabrication of thin  films of artificial diamond. He  has been awarded\nboth  a Ramsay  Memorial  Fellowship and  a  Royal Society  University\nFellowship. He also  received the RSC Higher  Education teaching award\nfor innovative use of IT in  chemistry teaching. He has written nearly\n200 scientific  articles and currently  maintains the Molecule  of the\nMonth website.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0392efab7961eecfa85529fa8ad3047dc6d7b83","amp;dn":"Molecules+that+Amaze+Us+-+Paul+May%2C+Simon+Cotton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0392efab7961eecfa85529fa8ad3047dc6d7b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,57,46,250,183,150,30,236,250,133,82,159,168,173,48,71,220,109,123,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
