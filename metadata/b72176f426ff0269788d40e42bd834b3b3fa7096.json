This one-stop account - now in paperback, with corrections from the first printing - is the ideal way to get to grips with this topic, which has significant applications in industry and nature. Each chapter is written by an acknowledged expert and includes extensive references to current research. All of the chapters are essentially independent and so the book can be used for a range of advanced courses and the self-study of specific topics. No other book covers so many topics related to multiphase flow, and it will therefore be warmly welcomed by researchers and graduate students of the subject across engineering, physics, and applied mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72176f426ff0269788d40e42bd834b3b3fa7096","amp;dn":"Computational+Methods+for+Multiphase+Flow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72176f426ff0269788d40e42bd834b3b3fa7096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,33,118,244,38,255,2,105,120,141,64,228,43,216,52,179,179,250,112,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
