Taking the form of an Ã¢â‚¬Å“oralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ history, this books contains over 130 interviews, along with essential background information from acclaimed music writer Greg Prato. The early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s grunge movement may have last only a few years, but it spawned some of the greatest rock music of all time: Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden. This book contains the first-ever interview in which Pearl JamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eddie Vedder was willing to discuss the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history in great detail; Alice in ChainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ band members and Layne StaleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mom on StaleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drug addiction and death; insights into the Riot Grrrl movement and oft-overlooked but highly influential Seattle bands like Mother Love Bone/Andy Wood, the Melvins, Screaming Trees, and Mudhoney; and much more. Grunge Is Dead digs deeper than the average grunge history, starting in the early '60s, and explaining the chain of events that gave way to the grunge movement. The end result is a book that includes a wealth of previously untold stories and insight for the longtime fan, as well as its renowned story for the newcomer. Grunge Is Dead collects the whole truth of grunge music in one comprehensive volume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4025f40f97787ec8b5b48f855b77510fe77736","amp;dn":"Greg+Prato+Grunge+Is+Dead%2C+The+Oral+History+of+Seattle+Rock+Musi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4025f40f97787ec8b5b48f855b77510fe77736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,64,37,244,15,151,120,126,200,181,180,143,133,91,119,81,15,231,119,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
