Behind the pretty faÃƒÂ§ade, however, is a town at war: rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. A miniseries adaptation of J.K. Rowling's novel.\n\nEpisode 2 of 3:\n\nThe parish council election approaches and Pagford is on tenterhooks awaiting the next post from 'the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother'. Who is the Ghost, and what will they say? Is anyone in the village safe from humiliation? As tensions rise, the finger of suspicion points in many directions.\n\n=====================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 324MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 703Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n=====================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d1c6fc90b85772b1c5d3003219ee548d565b3b","amp;dn":"The+Casual+Vacancy+S01E02+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d1c6fc90b85772b1c5d3003219ee548d565b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,209,198,252,144,184,87,114,177,197,211,0,50,25,238,84,141,86,91,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
