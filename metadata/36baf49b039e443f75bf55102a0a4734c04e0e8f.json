It's the story of how - in the grey austerity of the postwar years - iconic marques like Jaguar, Austin-Healey, MG and Triumph sparked a manufacturing frenzy that helped to democratise speed and glamour.\n\nFrom the MG Midget, much loved by American GIs, through to the more affordable Austin Healey 'frog-eye' Sprite and the E-Type Jaguar, seen by many as the ultimate sports car, this is a tale of how, for a brief time, Britain was home to two-seater heaven.\n\nSource: BBC FOUR TS[MPEG/MPA] DDD\n\n\n\nMPEG 576i (CUVID HW Deinterlace) &gt; x264 (High @L3.1) 2pass 720*576 (1.09Gb) approx. 2.46Mbps\nMPA 224Kbps 48Khz &gt; AC3 192Kbps 48Khz\nmerged SRT English CC Subtitles (double-checked)\n\nSize: 1/4 DVD\n\nEnjoy,\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36baf49b039e443f75bf55102a0a4734c04e0e8f","amp;dn":"BBC+Timeshift+S12E04+-+Magnificent+Machines%2C+The+Golden+Age+of+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36baf49b039e443f75bf55102a0a4734c04e0e8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,186,244,155,3,158,68,63,117,191,85,16,42,10,71,52,192,78,14,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
