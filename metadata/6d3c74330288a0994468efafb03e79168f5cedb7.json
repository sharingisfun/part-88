It presents a thorough treatment of the standard topics in an accessible, easy-to-read, format. The overarching perspective of the text conveys that differential equations are about applications. This book illuminates the mathematical theory in the text with a wide variety of applications that will appeal to students in physics, engineering, the biosciences, economics and mathematics. Instructors are likely to find that the first four or five chapters are suitable for a first course in the subject.\n\nThis edition contains a healthy increase over earlier editions in the number of worked examples and exercises, particularly those routine in nature. Two appendices include a review with practice problems, and a MATLABÃ‚Â® supplement that gives basic codes and commands for solving differential equations. MATLABÃ‚Â® is not required; students are encouraged to utilize available software to plot many of their solutions. Solutions to even-numbered problems are available on springer.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3c74330288a0994468efafb03e79168f5cedb7","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Differential+Equations%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3c74330288a0994468efafb03e79168f5cedb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,60,116,51,2,136,160,153,68,104,239,175,176,62,121,22,143,92,237,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
