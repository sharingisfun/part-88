The chronologically-sequenced anthology is the first to combine band and solo tracks, but the third overall for the band following 1999Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Turn It on Again: The Hits (reissued and expanded in 2007) and 2004Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s three-disc Platinum Collection.  (Mention should also be made of StarbucksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ career-spanning Opus Collection volume, 14 from Our Past, which arrived in 2007 to coincide with the Banks/Collins/Rutherford reunion tour.)  It surveys the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire prog-to-pop journey.\n\nIn addition to 22 songs pulled from all of GenesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ studio albums, each member is represented with three Ã¢â‚¬Å“sideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tracks.  From Collins, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear the hit Philip Bailey duet Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easy LoverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plus Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Air TonightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and more surprisingly, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wake Up CallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 2002Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Testify.  GabrielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo catalogue has yielded Ã¢â‚¬Å“Solsbury HillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plus Ã¢â‚¬Å“BikoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Signal to Noise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Hackett is represented with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ace of WandsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1975), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Every DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1979) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“NomadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2009); Banks with Ã¢â‚¬Å“For a WhileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1975), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red Day on Blue StreetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1991) and the collectionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SirenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2012); and Rutherford with three songs from Mike and the Mechanics: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silent Running,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Living YearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over My Shoulder.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676b50b8877472e9400ba0854d8326b4cd3c3de8","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+R-Kive+%5BBox+Set%5D+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676b50b8877472e9400ba0854d8326b4cd3c3de8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,107,80,184,135,116,114,233,64,11,160,133,77,131,38,180,205,60,61,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
