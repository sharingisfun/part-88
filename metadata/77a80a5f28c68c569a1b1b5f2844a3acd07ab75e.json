In this unique book, each step in the casting and solidification process is described and models are set up, which in many cases can be approximated by simplified analytical expressions. All casting methods are featured, including component casting, ingot casting and continuous casting.\nApplications of the results are given in numerous worked examples within the text. Conclusions on how to avoid cracks, solidification pores, slag inclusions and other defects of the castings, can be drawn from the theoretical models. These conclusions are based on research results, which together give an idea of the development in the manufacture of castings. Most chapters conclude with a number of exercises, answers to which are given at the end of the book. The accompanying 'Guide to Exercises', provides the complete solutions to each of the exercises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a80a5f28c68c569a1b1b5f2844a3acd07ab75e","amp;dn":"Materials+Processing+During+Casting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a80a5f28c68c569a1b1b5f2844a3acd07ab75e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,168,10,95,40,198,140,86,154,27,27,95,40,68,163,172,208,122,183,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
