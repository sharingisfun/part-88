The group's roots date to 1965, a period when a teenage Nugent was living in Chicago; there he formed the first incarnation of the Amboy Dukes, borrowing the moniker from a recently disbanded Detroit band who themselves took the name from an infamous exploitation novel of the period. When Nugent returned to Southeastern Michigan in 1967, he assembled a new Dukes lineup including vocalist John Drake, his former bandmate in the Lourds, as well as rhythm guitarist Steve Farmer, bassist Bill White, keyboardist Rick Lober, and drummer Dave Palmer. Famed for its snarling closer, an incendiary cover of Them's &quot;Baby Please Don't Go,&quot; the group emerged as one of the hottest attractions on the Detroit club circuit. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Sony/Epic/Legacy\nIncluded.............:Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Journey To The Center Of The Mind\n02.Baby Please Don't Go\n03.Psalms Of Aftermath\n04.Colors\n05.Down On Phillips Escalator\n06.Night Time\n07.Mississippi Murderer\n08.Scottish Tea\n09.Dr. Slingshot\n10.Flight Of The Bird\n11.Why Is A Carrot More Orange Than A Orange\n12.Saint Phillips Friend\n13.You Talk Sunshine, I Breathe Fire\n14.Migration\n15.Prodigal Man\n16.Good Natured Emma\n17.For His Namesake\n18.Loaded For Bear\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66588ef6c637c40db49171d06b0cd5d48f07f506","amp;dn":"Loaded+For+Bear+Best+Of+Ted+Nugent+%26amp%3B+The+Amboy+Dukes+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66588ef6c637c40db49171d06b0cd5d48f07f506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,88,142,246,198,55,196,13,180,145,113,208,107,12,213,212,143,7,245,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
