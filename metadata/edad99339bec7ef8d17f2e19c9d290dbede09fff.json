The Series was the first to be fitted with a microprocessor equipped engine control system, which was later to be adopted on a number of diesel locomotives. \n\nWith an output of 4,000hp and a top speed of 68mph (109 km/h), the Dash 8 was considered a heavy duty freight locomotive and was fitted with standard GE equipment, including dynamic braking but without display screens, preferring to retain old style gauges and dials on a tall console in the driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cab. \n\nAlongside CSX Transportation and Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern originally purchased 89 units and inherited more Dash 8s from Conrail when the two railroads merged. The Dash8-40C for Train Simulator recreates the original locomotive with narrow nose as it operates for Norfolk Southern. \n\nFeatures of the model include instrument and cab lighting, dynamic braking and Norfolk Southern coal gondolas.
