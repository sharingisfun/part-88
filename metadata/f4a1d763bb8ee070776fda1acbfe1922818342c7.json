The rider (the one who gives a ride) belongs to an alien race, the hoots, that landed human generations ago. Now the hoots keep humans as mounts, breeding them much as humans once bred horses. The very best mounts are imprinted as infants and train with their riders from childhood. Charley, one of the best, is destined to be the mount of The-future-supreme-ruler-of-us-all...\n\nA memorable alien-invasion scenario, a wild adventure, and a reflection on the dynamics of freedom and slavery. It won the Philip K. Dick Award in 2002, and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2003.15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a1d763bb8ee070776fda1acbfe1922818342c7","amp;dn":"Carol+Emshwiller+-+The+Mount","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a1d763bb8ee070776fda1acbfe1922818342c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,161,215,99,187,142,224,112,119,111,218,26,203,254,25,34,129,131,66,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
