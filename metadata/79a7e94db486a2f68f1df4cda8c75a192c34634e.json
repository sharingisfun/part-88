He emerges into a world of about 60 teen boys who have learned to survive in a completely enclosed environment, subsisting on their own agriculture and supplies. A new boy arrives every 30 days. The original group has been in &quot;The Glade&quot; for two years, trying to find a way to escape through the Maze that surrounds their living space. They have begun to give up hope. Then a comatose girl arrives with a strange note, and their world begins to change. There are some great, fast-paced action scenes, particularly those involving the nightmarish Grievers who plague the boys.\n\n---------------\n\nSample included\n\n---------------\n\nEnjoy\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a7e94db486a2f68f1df4cda8c75a192c34634e","amp;dn":"Maze.Runner.2014.Cam.x264-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a7e94db486a2f68f1df4cda8c75a192c34634e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,167,233,77,180,134,162,246,143,29,244,205,168,199,90,25,44,52,99,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
