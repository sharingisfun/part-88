Trump has a plan to make America great again.\n\nPresident Obama has been a disaster for this country. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrecked our economy, saddled our children with debt, and gone around the world apologizing for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€as if the greatest nation in the world needed to apologize for being the land of opportunity and freedom that we were before Obama became president.\n\nNow, America looks like a broken countryÃ¢â‚¬â€stripped of jobs, stripped of wealth, stripped of respect. And what does President Obama do about it? He plays nice with the very same foreign governments who are eager to watch America burn.\n\nThis canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go on. And if Donald J. Trump has anything to say about it, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nIn his blockbuster book, Time to Get Tough, Trump has the answers America has been looking for, including:\n    -How to finally secure our border and fix our immigration overflow\n    -How to create American jobs by forcing Communist China into truly fair trade\n    -How to retire our debt without endangering long-established programsÃ¢â‚¬â€like Social Security, Medicare, and MedicaidÃ¢â‚¬â€that millions of Americans depend on\n    -How to undo the fraud of Obamanomics and the disaster of Obamacare\n\n\nBlunt, straightforward, and honest, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all trademark Trump, setting out a common sense agenda to restore American prosperity and make our nation respected once again.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, investor, television personality, and author. Currently running for the office of President of the United States, he is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts.\n\nDonald Trump is the very definition of the American success story, continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate, sports and entertainment.
