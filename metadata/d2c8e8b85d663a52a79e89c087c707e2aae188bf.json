It received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. Monsieur Henri Lambert is a world-famous magician. Because his carefully rehearsed performances astound even the most critical audiences, the Emperor sends him to Algeria. There, Lambert must dazzle its leaders and convince them the French have special powers. As an added attraction, Emmeline, his unsophisticated young wife, is to accompany him. But in this unfamiliar landscape, when Emmeline discovers the deception involved in the EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan, she decides to shift its outcome. Moore skillfully tightens the suspense, infusing it with lyrical passages that highlight EmmelineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growing intelligence. Narrator Graeme MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s European tones capture the international flair of this outstanding book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c8e8b85d663a52a79e89c087c707e2aae188bf","amp;dn":"Brian+Moore-The+Magician%27s+Wife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c8e8b85d663a52a79e89c087c707e2aae188bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,200,232,184,93,102,58,82,167,158,137,192,135,199,7,226,170,225,136,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
