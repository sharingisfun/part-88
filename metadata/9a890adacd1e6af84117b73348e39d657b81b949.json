The long method of getting this is downloading the SDK and running it.

Extra the files into a folder.\n3. Plug your phone in.\n4. When prompted, select &quot;Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer&quot;, NOT &quot;browse for driver software on your computer&quot;.\n5. Then you have to select &quot;have disk&quot; and then point to where you extracted the drivers (the usb_driver folder) to install the drivers.\n\nIf you already installed other drivers and they don't work for you.
