A band followed, evolving into Flying Colors: Mike Portnoy (drums, vocals), Dave LaRue (bass), Neal Morse (keyboards, vocals), Casey McPherson (lead vocals), and Steve Morse (guitar). Together, they create a unique fusion of vintage craftsmanship, contemporary music and blistering live performances.\n\nIn 2008, executive producer Bill Evans began putting the idea into action. It needed exactly the right musicians. In addition to be being extraordinary players and writers, they would need to be a natural creative fit, complementing each othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ abilities. There would be proven chemistry from past collaborations, but the new band would be different from anything theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done. The world didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need another supergroup.\n\nAs with the classic albums, there also would be a strong production team who, creatively, would be an extension of the band: a visionary producer, imaginative engineer and compelling visual artist. Though they were seasoned artists with impressive backgrounds and catalogs, this would be new territory for most of them. And without a budget or a label, they came together with nothing more than a shared vision to create something special and unique.\n\n\n\nLine-up:\n\n   Casey McPherson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, electric guitar, keyboard\n   Steve Morse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic guitar, electric guitar\n   Dave LaRue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n   Neal Morse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboard, vocals\n   Mike Portnoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drum, percussion, vocals\n\n\n\nS/t debut full-lenght released in 2012.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Blue Ocean&quot;   7:05\n2. &quot;Shoulda Coulda Woulda&quot;   4:32\n3. &quot;Kayla&quot;   5:20\n4. &quot;The Storm&quot;   4:53\n5. &quot;Forever in a Daze&quot;   3:56\n6. &quot;Love is What I'm Waiting For&quot;   3:36\n7. &quot;Everything Changes&quot;   6:55\n8. &quot;Better Than Walking Away&quot;   4:57\n9. &quot;All Falls Down&quot;   3:22\n10. &quot;Fool in My Heart&quot;   3:48\n11. &quot;Infinite Fire&quot;   12:02\n\n\n\nGenre:\tRock\nSubgenre:\tHard Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t136.59 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files\n10 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89101e9e0682ce55227471d8c99ab989286fcd7d","amp;dn":"+Flying+Colors++-+Flying+Colors++mp3++2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89101e9e0682ce55227471d8c99ab989286fcd7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,16,30,158,6,130,206,85,34,116,113,216,201,154,185,137,40,111,205,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
