It also reviews modern biomass-based transportation fuels, including biodiesel, bio-oil, biomethane and biohydrogen.\n\nEach chapter opens with fundamental explanations suitable for those with a general interest in algae energy and goes on to provide in-depth scientific details for more expert readers. Algae energy is discussed within the wider context of green energy, with chapters covering topics such as: green energy facilities, algae technology, energy from algae and biodiesel from algae.\n\nAlgae Energy addresses the needs of energy researchers, chemical engineers, fuel and environmental engineers, postgraduate and advanced undergraduate students, and others interested in a practical tool for pursuing their interest in bio-energy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2f1820d50bb594d90327c40b7670eb588715db","amp;dn":"Algae+Energy+-+Algae+as+a+New+Source+of+Biodiesel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2f1820d50bb594d90327c40b7670eb588715db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,47,24,32,213,11,181,148,217,3,39,196,11,118,112,235,88,135,21,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
