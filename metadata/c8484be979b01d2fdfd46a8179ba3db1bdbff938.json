The range of biofuels has also increased to supplement bioethanol and biodiesel production, with market developments leading to the increased production and utilisation of such biofuels as biosyngas, biohydrogen and biobutanol, among others.\n\nHandbook of biofuels production provides a comprehensive and systematic reference on the range of biomass conversion processes and technology. Part one reviews the key issues in the biofuels production chain, including feedstocks, sustainability assessment and policy development.\n\nPart two reviews chemical and biochemical conversion and in turn Part three reviews thermal and thermo-chemical conversion, with both sections detailing the wide range of processes and technologies applicable to the production of first, second and third generation biofuels. Finally, Part four reviews developments in the integration of biofuels production, including biorefineries and by-product valorisation, as well as the utilisation of biofuels in diesel engines.\n\nWith its distinguished international team of contributors, Handbook of biofuels production is a standard reference for biofuels production engineers, industrial chemists and biochemists, plant scientists, academics and researchers in this area.\nA comprehensive and systematic reference on the range of biomass conversion processes and technologies\nAddresses the key issues in the biofuels production chain, including feedstocks, sustainability assessment and policy development\nReviews chemical and bio-chemical conversion techniques as well as thermal and thermo-chemical conversion, detailing the range of processes and technologies applicable to biofuels production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8484be979b01d2fdfd46a8179ba3db1bdbff938","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Biofuels+Production+-+Processes+and+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8484be979b01d2fdfd46a8179ba3db1bdbff938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,72,75,233,121,176,29,47,223,212,106,129,121,186,61,177,189,191,249,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
