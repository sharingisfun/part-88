Only -- she's doing it on a feature-length scale!\nEmily has the vision and her mom has the driver's license. Together, their journy is a fascinating look at a growing world of young moviemakers and the bloodiest mother/daughter story you've ever seen.\n\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nPathogen -- Emily's feature-length zombie movie (68 minutes)\nQ&amp;A with the cast &amp; crew of Pathogen at its world premiere\nA behind-the-scenes look at the making of Emily's second feature film, The Retelling\nEmily reflects on lessons learned from Pathogen as she prepares for her third movie\nOriginal theatrical trailer for Zombie Girl: The Movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be2ae1bfe3dd71268e3b95f6954d991beb0d77d","amp;dn":"Zombie+Girl+-+The+Movie+%5BDVDR+2009+zombie+movie+documentary+%2B+fe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be2ae1bfe3dd71268e3b95f6954d991beb0d77d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,226,174,27,254,61,215,18,104,227,185,95,105,84,217,145,190,176,215,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
