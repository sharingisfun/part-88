Featuring hypnotic grooves and ominous moods, there is an unsettling feeling throughout this score that is in part due to the subject matter, but heightened by ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique keyboard stylings. Here for the first time are extended improvisations, spontaneous compositions and thoughtful ramblings by one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maverick composers. In the tradition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“composers at the pianoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recordings (Mingus, Bacharach, Ives), this CD is a fascinating peek into the inner ear of Zorn the composer. One can literally hear him thinking, developing ideas aloud, aided by the most supportive possible environment in the person of Cyro Baptista, ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest musical associateÃ¢â‚¬â€they have been working together consistently since 1981Ã¢â‚¬â€and Shanir Blumenkranz, the young bass player from Satlah, Rashanim and PharaohÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter. A must for any Zorn fan, this is one of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most interesting, enjoyable and personal recordings. \n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista: Percussion\nShanir Ezra Blumenkranz: Bass, Oud\nJohn Zorn: Electric Pianos \n\n\n    &quot;Protocols Of Zion&quot; - 4:27\n    &quot;Searching For A Past&quot; - 5:22\n    &quot;Jew Watcher&quot; - 2:43\n    &quot;Mystery Of The Jew&quot; - 4:09\n    &quot;History Repeats Itself&quot; - 2:14\n    &quot;Arab And Jew&quot; - 5:57\n    &quot;Fighting Time&quot; - 5:02\n    &quot;Hollywood/Rikers&quot; - 2:36\n    &quot;Elders Of Zion&quot; - 5:26\n    &quot;A Dark Future&quot; - 4:31\n    &quot;Transition 1&quot; - 0:31\n    &quot;Transition 2&quot; - 0:17\n    &quot;Transition 3&quot; - 0:30\n    &quot;Transition 4&quot; - 0:25\n    &quot;Coda - The Metaphysics Of Anti-Semitism&quot; - 1:46\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:961f3a301756bf28a141c99b9d39cd91632667b0","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+15+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"961f3a301756bf28a141c99b9d39cd91632667b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,31,58,48,23,86,191,40,161,65,201,155,157,57,205,145,99,38,103,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
