The romantic string arrangements on standout tracks such as Betrayed or Wildflower place them somewhere between contemporary folk and 60s pop; the harmonies on Woman of Secret Gold might call to mind Harriet Wheeler of the Sundays to some; the chimes and cello accompaniment on the closing title track leave you wanting more.\n\nIf You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Love This All Goes AwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ seems like a soulfully sweet tune, but underneath it all there is some atmospheric guitar dissonance giving fair warning before the chorus intervenes with its swirling strings. Shifting between major and minor, a chorus made for radio and a meandering collection of verses and bridges, this is an off-kilter soul tune to die for. Basically, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all over the place. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no easy way to describe it and yet at the end of it all it contrives to make perfect modern-pop sense.\nRating\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Show Me.flac\n02 - Pages Of Gold.flac\n03 - If You Can't Love This All Goes Away.flac\n04 - Betrayed.flac\n05 - Sleeplessy Dreaming.flac\n06 - I Only Like His Hat, Not Him.flac\n07 - Wildflower.flac\n08 - Why.flac\n09 - Woman Of Secret Gold.flac\n10 - Tommorrow Will Be Beautiful.flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Indie-Folk\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~699-866 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce249d6dd03bdac83685dc55d98d8fa35c4bfb3a","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Flo+Morrissey+-+Tomorrow+Will+Be+Beautiful+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce249d6dd03bdac83685dc55d98d8fa35c4bfb3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,36,157,109,208,59,218,200,54,133,220,85,217,141,143,163,92,75,251,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
