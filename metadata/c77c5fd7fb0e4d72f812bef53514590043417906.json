The miraculous sole survivor is a three-month-old baby girl. Two families, one rich, the other poor, step forward to claim her, sparking an investigation that will last for almost two decades. Is she Lyse-Rose or Emilie?\n\nEighteen years later, having failed to discover the truth, private detective Credule Grand-Duc plans to take his own life, but not before placing an account of his investigation in the girl's hands. But, as he sits at his desk about to pull the trigger, he uncovers a secret that changes everything - then is killed before he can breathe a word of it to anyone...\n\n\n More information:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/michel-bussi-after-crash.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.69books.com/2015/07/michel-bussi-after-crash.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nConvert ebook:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.69books.com/p/about.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.69books.com/p/about.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77c5fd7fb0e4d72f812bef53514590043417906","amp;dn":"Michel+Bussi%3A+After+the+Crash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77c5fd7fb0e4d72f812bef53514590043417906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,124,95,215,251,14,77,114,248,18,190,245,53,20,89,0,67,65,121,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
