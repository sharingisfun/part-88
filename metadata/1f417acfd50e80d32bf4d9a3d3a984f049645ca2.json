Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for 'rent' (actually to repay violent loan-shark Cadillac Tom), which the half-wit gets by - stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.\n\n\nIMDB:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271885/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271885/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaaehAAGL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaaehAAGL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nPlease seed for others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f417acfd50e80d32bf4d9a3d3a984f049645ca2","amp;dn":"Zig+Zag+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f417acfd50e80d32bf4d9a3d3a984f049645ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,65,122,207,213,14,128,211,43,244,217,163,211,169,132,240,73,100,92,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
