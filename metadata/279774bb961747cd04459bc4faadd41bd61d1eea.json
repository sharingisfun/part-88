The guy's got a lot of heart-luckily for a young nun named\nIndex. She's on the run from a sorcery society that covets the astonishing 103,000\nvolumes of magical knowledge stored in her memory. When Index stumbles into \nKamijo's life, she find a faithful friend and protector, and while Kamijo's easily\nthe weakest kid in Academy City, he's got something else going for him: the \nImagine Breaker, an unexplainable power stored in his right hand that negates the\npowers of others. With scientists and sorcerers attacking from all sides, the \nImagine Breaker will definitely come in handy-but it's Kamijo's loyalty to Index\nthat will be his greatest weapon in the fight to keep her safe.\n\nAudio: English,Japanese\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\n\nFormat: MKV\n\n\n                               please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279774bb961747cd04459bc4faadd41bd61d1eea","amp;dn":"A+Certain+Magical+Index","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279774bb961747cd04459bc4faadd41bd61d1eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,151,116,187,150,23,71,205,4,69,155,196,250,173,212,27,214,29,30,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
