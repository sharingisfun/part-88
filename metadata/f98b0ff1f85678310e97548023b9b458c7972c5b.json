In 1997 the original line-up consisting of band founder Asvargr (guitar), vocalist Azathoth, Njord on bass, drummer Charon established the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first live line-up with the addition of a second guitarist named Crom and keyboardist Thamuz. Debuting live in February 1997 the young horde soon shared the stage with such underground figureheads as Lunar Aurora, Desaster and Nagelfar. Dark FortressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first label release was the Split MCD with Barad DÃƒÂ¼r entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Towards ImmortaliyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which featured two new tracks by the band and was released on Fog Of The Apocalypse Records. A third track was recorded during the same session and was used for the compilation CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“From The Mystic Forest - Part IIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The band kept busy composing material for the first full-length, but a studio date already scheduled for 1998 did not come into being and the recording did not take place until August 2000 when Dark Fortress entered Klangschmiede Studio E and with Markus Stock (of Empyrium fame) behind the knobs completed one of the strongest melodic yet viciously aggressive black/death metal debuts ever to emerge from Germany: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tales From Eternal DuskÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Taking inspiration from such renowned acts like Dissection, Unanimated and Satyricon the album received nothing but praise and offered a magnificent mixture of hauntingly beautiful guitar melodies, morbid and tormented snarling and diversified song structuresÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a destined to be classic release! ine-up changes (Charon and Crom left due to conflicting musical interests) delayed further live and studio activities, but with signing to US label Red Stream for two albums and the addition of new drummer Seraph and guitarist Santura, Dark Fortress was back with a vengeance! Recorded at famous Grieghallen Studio in Norway (Mayhem, Emperor, ImmortalÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) Ã¢â‚¬Å“Profane Genocidal CreationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was an ambitious yet delayed album due to problems during the mixing/mastering process.\n\n\nTrack list:\n1.
