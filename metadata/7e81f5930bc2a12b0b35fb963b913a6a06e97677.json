An interesting contrast is established between 'Popeye' Doyle, a short-tempered alcoholic bigot who is nevertheless a hard-working and dedicated police officer, and his nemesis Alain Charnier, a suave and urbane gentleman who is nevertheless a criminal and one of the largest drug suppliers of pure heroin to North America. During the surveillance and eventual bust, Friedkin provides one of the most gripping and memorable car chase sequences ever filmed.\n\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n\n\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067116&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067116&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOther Downloads you may Like\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e81f5930bc2a12b0b35fb963b913a6a06e97677","amp;dn":"The+French+Connection+-+Multi+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e81f5930bc2a12b0b35fb963b913a6a06e97677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,129,245,147,11,194,161,43,11,53,251,150,59,145,58,106,6,233,118,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
