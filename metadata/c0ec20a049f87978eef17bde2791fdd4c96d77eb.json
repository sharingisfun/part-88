The proÃ‚Â­gram was initiated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama to introduce science into the Tibetan Buddhist monastic tradition.\n\nIn a vivid and compelling narrative, Impey introÃ‚Â­duces us to a group of exiled Tibetan monks whose charm, tenacity and unbridled enthusiasm for learning is infectious. Impey marvels not only at their enthusiasm, but at their tireless diligence that allows the monks to painstakingly build intriÃ‚Â­cate sand mandalasÃ¢â‚¬â€that can be swept away in an instant. He observes them as they meticulously count galaxies and notes how their enthusiasm and diligence stands in contrast to many American students who are frequently turned off by sciÃ‚Â­enceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to deliver easy, immediate payoffs. Because the Buddhist monks have had a limited science education, Impey must devise creative pedagogy. His new students immediately take to his inspired teaching methods, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the use of balloons to demonstrate the Hubble expansion or donning an Einstein mask to explain the theory of relativity.\n\nHumble before the Void also recounts ImpeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences outside the classroom, from the monksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eagerness to engage in pick-up basketÃ‚Â­ball games and stream episodes of hip American sitcoms to the effects on his relationship with the teenage son who makes the trip with him. Moments of profound serenity and beauty in the Himalayas are contrasted with the sorrow of learning that other monks have set themselves on fire to protest the Chinese oppression in Tibet.\n\nAt the end of the three week program, both the monks and Impey have gained a valuable eduÃ‚Â­cation. While the monks have a greater underÃ‚Â­standing and appreciation of science, Impey has acquired greater self- knowledge and a deeper understanding of the nature of learning and teaching in the East and West. This understandÃ‚Â­ing leads to a renewed enthusiasm for making his topic come alive for others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ec20a049f87978eef17bde2791fdd4c96d77eb","amp;dn":"+Humble+before+the+Void+-+Chris+Impey+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ec20a049f87978eef17bde2791fdd4c96d77eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,236,32,160,73,248,121,120,238,241,123,222,39,145,253,212,201,109,119,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
