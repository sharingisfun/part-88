This is about as close to a generic definition as I'm willing to go for the benefit of newbies -- anyone with a reasonable grasp of the genre surely understands the inherent variety caused by the more avant-garde bands as well as various partial fusions with other genres. One can just as easily find a slow doom/death album as a melodic, clean sung one; a somewhat noise-based, much less melodic approach is not uncommon, and a mix of black and doom metal is not unheard of either.\n\nGiven these first few lines about what doom metal sounds like, I was initially going to write an introduction describing how I first encountered doom metal many moons ago, and how the music has affected my life and so on; but I won't, because none of you would care. No, not a single one of you cold-hearted people would give a damn. So I'll just go sit alone in my corner, thinking about life and the state of this bleak world and listening to some doom metal -- and you can write this damn article yourselves if you want.\n\nJoking aside, the paragraph above tries to illustrate what I think truly separates doom from every other metal genre: when done right, it is by far the most personal, introspective and individual of them all. With this I don't mean to raise doom above other genres, or call it more profound or distinctive than the others. All I mean by this is that people can head-bang and fist-pump together to death or thrash metal, they can try black magic and pull grim faces together with black metal, they can air-guitar and croon together to heavy or progressive metal... but a good doom metal album is something you take along when you want to be by yourself, when you need some isolation. While this can also be achieved with other genres and entirely depends on the taste of each individual, I think that contrary to other genres, this is what doom metal was truly created for. Or in the context of the less serious kind of treatment I just gave the other genres, doom metal is made for those beings that are overly sensitive and depressed, and aren't doing anything about it.\nimage\n01.Blackwolfgoat - Tyche 04:11\n02.At Devil Dirt - Let It Flow 06:57\n03.Low Gravity - 27 Names 07:42\n04.Ichabod - Hollow God 05:46\n05.Fister - Deaf Wish 04:40\n06.Undersmile - Anchor 12:43\n07.Compel - A National Acrobat (Black Sabbath) 06:50\n08.Iron Man - Choices (Acoustic) 04:28\n09.Wizard's Beard - Subirse el Muerto 08:34\n10.OceansRainbow - Metatron's Cube 12:28\n11.Beelzefuzz - Peace Mind 02:35\n12.Conan - Hawk as Weapon (Live) 06:50\n13.Lazarus Complex - The Least of These 04:42\n14.Spyderbone - Your God 05:15\n15.Order of the Owl - Cocaine Super Demon (7-Inch Edit) 05:55\n16.Dope Flood - Uncertain 04:42\n17.War Injun - War Injun 07:50\n18.Heathen Bastard - Cannabis Giganticus 03:17\n19.Halmos - Theory 05:56\n20.KriÃ…Â¾ - Surrounded by Evil (Fulfilled with Love) 04:22\n21.Bongripper - Sex Tape 04:12\n22.Demonaut - Fallen/Risen 05:15\n23.In the Company of Serpents - Malice 07:38\n24.Switchblade Jesus - Oblivion (Live) 07:08\n25.Pale Divine - Black Coven 06:10\n26.When the Deadbolt Breaks - The Scavengers Daughter 07:24\n27.Bastard of the Skies - Grays Sports Almanac 03:49\n28.Gorgantherron - Cemetery Shoes 03:31\n29.Screaming Mad Dee and Alex Vanderzeeuw - The Situation Dies 02:47\n30.Chowder - The Innsmouth Look 03:40\n31.War Iron - Inch Cape 12:09\n32.Hollow Leg - Warbeast 06:41\n33.Crawl - Butchers Hollar 02:48\n34.Desolation - The Light is Gone 10:35\n35.Ketea - Quiet Ruin 09:18\n36.Sludgethrone - Tortured Reach 07:00\n37.Vulture - Long I Crawl 05:38\n38.Wolfpussy - Last Call 03:25\n39.The Departure - Farewell 03:50\n\nimage\n01.Salem's Pot - The Aquarian Age 21:12\n02.Grifter - Alabama Hotpocket 03:43\n03.Pike - Rituale Romanum 10:55\n04.Undersmile - Hives 08:19\n05.Catapult The Dead - Valencia 04:54\n06.Camel Of Doom - The Anger Of Anguish 13:26\n07.The Jackpine Snag - The Devil's Crawl 02:02\n08.Snake Oil - Slowdance For The Apocalypse 03:14\n09.Jethou - Scorpio 03:58\n10.The Curse Of Wendigo - Wildhoney 06:07\n11.Spiral - The Snake 09:04\n12.Graveflower - My Turn 11:04\n13.Mothersloth - Supersun 05:43\n14.King Bong - A.
