But while attempting to raise the sub, radioactive leakage from its missiles triggers the re-emergence of Atlantis, and the resulting tidal wave destroys the platform and leaves only a small group of survivors. Rescued by two Vietnam vets-turned-heavies who are out relaxing after their latest job, their boat eventually runs aground on a Caribbean island nearby where, upon going ashore, it is discovered that everything has been destroyed and everybody killed. The culprits, a vicious group of well-armed raiders, and their leader, Crystal Skull, are descendants of Atlantis' original race who set about reclaiming the world and adding the survivors to the list of victims as they struggle to stay alive and defeat the raiders and send Atlantis back to the ocean floor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99dfeeaf5e97242d7cf4619ef596f8300869f7d4","amp;dn":"Raiders+Of+Atlantis+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99dfeeaf5e97242d7cf4619ef596f8300869f7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,223,238,175,94,151,36,45,124,244,97,158,245,150,248,48,8,105,247,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
