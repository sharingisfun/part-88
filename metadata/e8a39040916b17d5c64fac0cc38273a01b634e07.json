It is absolutely imperative that you leave our show with a smile on your face and an ache in your neck&quot;\n\nFormerly known as Driven, this quintet have come a long way from their groove laden metalcore roots, and the progression from debut EP Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Breakdown of CharacterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (released via iTunes/Amazon in 2012) to their recent debut Album marks a big step up in songwriting, production and maturity, all of which continue to flourish.\n\nSince the bands inception, the boys have been creating a vicious racket on the live front. Following a high octane\nset at Hammerfest 2013 in North Wales, they have played sold out shows at The Borderline, Camden Barfly and Relentless Garage in\nLondon, and have shared the stage with countless awesome bands throughout the UK, as well as long established acts such as Knuckledust and US rockers Pop Evil. Many new friends have been made, and audiences seemingly blown away in the process.\n\nIn September 2014 came the release of debut album &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;, which continues to receive glowing praise, earning a plethora of positive reviews, both on home soil and overseas, and kindly hailed as one of the best underground albums of 2014 by Metalmouth.net. The album is built upon three years of growth, and the crafting and finalization of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity, with a name change acting as the final piece of the jigsaw.\n\nThe boys were recently included in VH1's &quot;15 Metal bands you should be listening to in 2015&quot;, and album singles &quot;Draw The Line&quot; and &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; have earned their place on the Kerrang Radio and Scuzz TV playlists.\n\n&quot;Blending a perfect mix of miasmic melodies, infectious inflections and a formidable fusion of styles, In Search Of Sun have come a long way in a relatively short time. Their music has strengthened, tightened and matured. They have broken away from stereotypes and listened to their hearts for inspiration, rather than genre definitions. The jump from E.P to album gives their fans a chance to experience a raw, piercing side of the band that they had never heard before. If they keep this up it will not be long before In Search of Sun will be finding themselves touring abroad to a much larger audience compelled by their sound.&quot;\n\n\nADAM LEADER - Vocals\nRORY KAY - Guitars\nDAVID MENA FERRER - Guitars\nFAZ COURI - Bass\nSEAN GORMAN - Drums &amp; Backing Vox\n\n\n\n\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The World Is Yours\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Give In\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 51 56\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In Search Of Sun\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Idle Crown\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Burn\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ To The Axe\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Skin\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Draw The Line\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eyes Behind I","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a39040916b17d5c64fac0cc38273a01b634e07","amp;dn":"In+Search+Of+Sun+-+The+World+Is+Yours+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a39040916b17d5c64fac0cc38273a01b634e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,163,144,64,145,107,23,213,198,79,172,12,195,130,115,160,27,99,78,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
