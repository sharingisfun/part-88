However, this track has been posted for a long time with no official release date, or even word about it. \n\nI got the best quality I could and at least made the tags look nice and added some album art. I know I enjoy this track enough to suffer with the lower quality until a proper release comes out.\n\nAs soon as it is officially released, I will have the full 320 kb/s quality mp3 posted. \n\nI hope you all enjoy it and again, please excuse the quality for now.\n\nTL;DR: quality isnt the best I know, track not officially released. Did the best I could.\n\n- Bloodshot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fffb0678d6252c9b157ce92469e4fa1110cdb9","amp;dn":"ZHU+-+Faded+%28Big+Gigantic+Remix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fffb0678d6252c9b157ce92469e4fa1110cdb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,255,251,6,120,214,37,44,155,21,124,233,36,105,228,250,17,16,205,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
