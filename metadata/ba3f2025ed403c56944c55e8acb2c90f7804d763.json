They would release their debut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come The MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album in 2001 and play extensively on the live circuit following its release alongside the likes of such bands as High On Fire, Goatsnake, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, Eyehategod, Yob, and Clutch to name just a few. Fast forward to 2009 after a lengthy hiatus and WITCH MOUNTAIN would regroup with a new young vocalist Uta Plotkin (taking over vocal duties from Wrong) and self-releasing their comeback album in 2010 Ã¢â‚¬Å“South Of SalemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to critical acclaim. Said album, alongside WITCH MOUNTAINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return introduced Uta Plotkin to the heavy music scene as she would inevitably be recognized as one of the most powerful and best female vocalists in heavy music today. This would be solidified even more in 2012 when WITCH MOUNTAIN released their Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cauldron Of The WildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album to even more widespread acclaim and endless touring around said release.\n\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mobile Of AngelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sees WITCH MOUNTAIN deliver their most epic and musically challenging album to date. Along with Uta Plotkin delivering her best vocal performance yet, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mobile Of AngelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a darker and more brooding album than any of its predecessors. With a cleaner and warmer sounding production (courtesy of legendary producer Billy Anderson, album tracked and mixed in Type Foundry studios Portland) yet still maintaining that massive heavy bluesy and melodic tone the band are known for, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mobile Of AngelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another formidable chapter in the WITCH MOUNTAIN saga that will see the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crossover appeal and awareness broaden even more.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
