Armed with a smuggled radio and a copy of 1984, Delisle could only explore Pyongyang and its countryside in the company of his translator and a guide. But among the statues, portraits and propaganda of leaders Kim Il-Sung and his son Kim Jong-Il - the world's only Communist dynasty - Delisle was able to observe more than was intended of the culture and lives of the few North Koreans he encountered.
