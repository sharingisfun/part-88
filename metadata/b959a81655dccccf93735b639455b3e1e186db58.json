If you listen to the album you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the work of only two musicians. With eight tracks clocking in at 40 minutes, NightfellÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Living Ever MournÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a heavy compilation fueled by the collision of riffs and guttural roars.\n\nThe album begins with Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Last DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, starting off with a melodic tone, before the track implodes. This is a pattern that can be found in a few of tracks on the record. The intro may be melodic, but it still possesses a sense of eerieness. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sort of more distant, hollow sounding build up that eventually leads to the harshness of the track.\n\nThe tracks Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœIIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which serve as interludes between the tracks, seem like an elongation of the intros found scattered among the tracks. It allows a moment of calm before the following song comes in wrecking everything in sight. The two tracks are also very similar sonically and can be considered continuations of one another. These are not gut wrenching songs to head bang to, so they simply serve as a way to build up the atmosphere.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe HollowingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an extremely intense track. Its fast-paced nature is present from the very first note. The focus of the track is on the marriage of the never ending riff alongside the steady drumming and harsh vocals. It only breaks its pattern towards the end of the track when it rolls into the bridge; where clean vocals come into the picture. Although, Ã¢â‚¬Å“cleanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ may not necessarily be the perfect word to describe the raspy, spoken passage.\n\nTo close the album off is the ever so powerful Ã¢â‚¬ËœFuneral DirgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, quite possibly the high point of the album. The track begins with a melodic tone before unleashing a crazy, skull crushing pace, that eventually leads back to slowing things down again towards the middle of the track (yes, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room to do all this; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an eight minute track!) The song brings NightfellÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs impressive debut to a close as it fades away to sound of only drums.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe Living Ever MournÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is solid album, made even more impressive by the fact that it is the two-man bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album. The record possesses everything you would look for: incredible riffs, infectious drumming and  the mixture of spoken passages and growling vocals. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dark, eerie feel throughout the record, and the several attempts to slow things down never really take away the heaviness of NightfellÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs sound. - Hitthefloor\n\nGenre:\tDoom\nSubgenre:\tDeath Crust\nBitrate:\tLossless\nSize:\t275.35 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\nFile Name \tSize\n08 - Funeral Dirge.flac \t50.93 MB\n01 - The Last Disease.flac \t44.40 MB\n05 - The Hollowing.flac \t43.03 MB\n03 - I Am Decay.flac \t41.71 MB\n04 - Empty Prayers.flac \t40.78 MB\n07 - Altars To Wrath.flac \t34.80 MB\n06 - Reaping Commences.flac \t11.37 MB\n02 - Apparitions Appear.flac \t6.65 MB\nInside (3).jpg \t400.51 KB\nInside (2).jpg \t386.29 KB\nInside (1).jpg \t330.79 KB\nCover.jpg \t325.67 KB\nTraycard.jpg \t268.84 KB\nNightfell - The Living Ever Mourn.log \t9.94 KB\nThe Living Ever Mourn.cue \t1.19 KB\nNightfell - The Living Ever Mourn.m3u \t0.53 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b959a81655dccccf93735b639455b3e1e186db58","amp;dn":"Nightfell+-+The+Living+Ever+Mourn+%282014%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b959a81655dccccf93735b639455b3e1e186db58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,89,168,22,85,220,204,207,147,115,91,99,148,85,179,225,225,134,219,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
