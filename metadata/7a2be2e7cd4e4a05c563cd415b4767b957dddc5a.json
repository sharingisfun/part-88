His big break came when he starred in a commercial for Coca-Cola, followed shortly in 1998 by his self-titled debut album for RCA. 2000 Watts arrived three years later and I Wanna Go There appeared a year after that, but it wasn't until late 2006 that he released his fourth album, Alter Ego, a double-disc set split between R&amp;B and rap material. Even with the four-year gap between releases, Alter Ego was Tyrese's fourth consecutive Top Ten R&amp;B album. Another five years passed before Open Invitation, where he declared to his listeners that music has always been his first love. A couple years later, he teamed up with Tank and Ginuwine for Three Kings, the debut album from his R&amp;B super-group TGT. A major success, it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2015, Tyrese announced that Black Rose would be his final solo album, another set split between rap and R&amp;B cuts. As an actor, he has either starred or co-starred in Baby Boy, Four Brothers, and several installments in the Fast and the Furious series. He has also executive produced a number of series for television, including First In, K-Town, and Roll Models. \n\n\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Voltron\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect\n\n\n01.Addict\n02.Dumb Shit (Feat.
