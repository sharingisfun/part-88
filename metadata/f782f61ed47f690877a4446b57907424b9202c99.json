Adventure through these abstract worlds, solve their challenges and discover their secrets in search of the key to HowardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future.\nThe different worlds that make up HowardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams can be strange, beautiful or even chilling. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re filled with puzzles, collectibles and surprises. Snow-covered deserts, endless twisted stairways, haunting nightmares and much more await you.\nWith non-linear narrative and gameplay you can explore at will and see the story progress according to your choices. Multiple possible endings mean the decisions you make and the dreams you experience will influence how HowardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future plays out.\nThe worlds of HowardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams are accompanied by an enchanting original soundtrack from composer Norman Legies.\nDream was created by HyperSloth, a team of three students from the university of Huddersfield whose mission is to create unique games suitable for wide audience and to a high standard. Dream is their first major release.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: OS\tWindows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7, Windows 8 / Windows 10\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz Dual Core Processor \nMemory: 2 GB RAM \nGraphics: Shader Model 3 compliant graphics cards (GeForce 8800, GeForce GT220 and above) \nDirect X: Version 9.0c \nHard Drive: 5 GB available space \nSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible, 16-bit \nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f782f61ed47f690877a4446b57907424b9202c99","amp;dn":"Dream+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f782f61ed47f690877a4446b57907424b9202c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,130,246,30,212,127,105,8,119,164,68,107,87,144,116,36,185,32,44,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
