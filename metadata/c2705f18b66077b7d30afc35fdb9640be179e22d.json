Best known for his high-energy blues-rock albums and live performances in the late 1960s and 1970s, Winter also produced three Grammy Award-winning albums for blues singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. After his time with Waters, Winter recorded several Grammy-nominated blues albums. In 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and in 2003, he was ranked 63rd in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n\nWinter was professionally active until the time of his death near Zurich, Switzerland, on July 16, 2014. He was found dead in his hotel room two days after his last performance, at the Cahors Blues Festival in France on July 14, at the age of 70. The cause of Winter's death is not clear.\n\nWriting in Rolling Stone magazine, after Winter's death, David Marchese said &quot;Winter was one of the first blues rock guitar virtuosos, releasing a string of popular and fiery albums in the late Sixties and early Seventies, becoming an arena-level concert draw in the process ... he made an iconic life for himself by playing the blues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStep Back is an album by blues guitarist and singer Johnny Winter. It features performances by a number of guest musicians, including Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top, Joe Perry from Aerosmith, and Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats. It was released by Megaforce Records on September 2, 2014.\n\nAs on Winter's previous studio album, Roots, the songs are mainly blues standards. Roots and Step Back were both produced by guitarist Paul Nelson.\n\nStep Back was released posthumously. Winter had finished recording the album, and then played a concert tour in Europe, before he died on July 16, 2014.\n\nStep Back debuted at #1 on the Billboard chart for Top Blues Albums, and #17 on the Billboard 200.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2705f18b66077b7d30afc35fdb9640be179e22d","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Step+Back+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2705f18b66077b7d30afc35fdb9640be179e22d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,112,95,24,182,96,119,183,211,10,252,53,253,185,100,11,225,121,226,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
