Evans (Cambridge, 2007).pdf\n\nISBN 9780521865630\n\nOne of the most important issues facing humanity today is the prospect of global climate change, brought about primarily by our prolific energy use and heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Fueling Our Future: An Introduction to Sustainable Energy provides a concise overview of current energy demand and supply patterns. It presents a balanced view of how our reliance on fossil fuels can be changed over time so that we have a much more sustainable energy system in the near future. Written in a non-technical and accessible style, the book will appeal to a wide range of readers without scientific backgrounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3dd23b6a32fc1f5fe2958da2744ea351569e92e","amp;dn":"Fueling+Our+Future+-+An+Introduction+to+Sustainable+Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3dd23b6a32fc1f5fe2958da2744ea351569e92e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,221,35,182,163,47,193,245,254,41,88,218,39,68,234,53,21,105,233,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
