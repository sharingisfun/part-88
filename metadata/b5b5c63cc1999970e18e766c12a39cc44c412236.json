After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism, and the advent of the Web which allowed for even the smallest voice to be heard, everywhere you turned you were told that we were living in an age of unparalleled freedom. 'You Can't Read This Book' argues that this view is dangerously naive. From the revolution in Iran that wasn't, to the Great Firewall of China and the imposition of super-injunctions from the filthy rich protecting their privacy, the traditional opponents of freedom of speech - religious fanaticism, plutocratic power and dictatorial states - are thriving and in many respects finding the world a more comfortable place in the early 21st century than they did in the late 20th. \n\n\nPublished by HarperCollins in 2012\n\nEPUB, Retail, 352 pages, English (9780007436453)\n\nuploaded for a friend who was unable to dl it from another site.\n\nPlease seed and share with others :)\n\nTPB forum: https://pirates-forum.org/\n\nTPB irc chan (EFNet): #thepiratebay.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b5c63cc1999970e18e766c12a39cc44c412236","amp;dn":"You+Can%27t+Read+This+Book%3A+Censorship+in+an+Age+of+Freedom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b5c63cc1999970e18e766c12a39cc44c412236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,181,198,60,193,153,153,112,225,142,118,108,18,163,156,196,76,65,34,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
