ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an absurd amount of time for a microscopically small, self-financed recording at any time Ã¢â‚¬â€ perhaps more so in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s, when not everybody had the means of producing, pressing and distributing an album electronically like so many bedroom artists today. The man responsible for Alien City was a Seattle, WA native named Jon Turnbow, and his labor of love is actually a concept album. The concept is a little vague, it is described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Incarnation of Celestial Visitors,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the message gets a bit lost over the course of the album.\n\nThe best description one could give of Alien City would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ziggy StardustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aladdin SaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ era Bowie, a little more glam/prog, a little less punk, and a bit more out of left field. Reports indicate that Jon might have spent time in an asylum after recording this album. Unlike Stephen David Heitkotter Ã¢â‚¬â€ whose stunning album Heitkotter was posted here on Monday Ã¢â‚¬â€ hopefully he has since been rehabilitated.\n\nOriginal copies included a lyric sheet. There are currently no plans for a reissue, but just like the Harbinger album yesterday and the Heitkotter LP on Monday, both of these lost gems deserve to be heard. Thanks again to Swan Fungus reader Viagra Falls for this recording Ã¢â‚¬â€ I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to see what else he uncovers for us to enjoy in the future.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
