Former Navy SEAL Scot Harvath is back, and in fine form. After a bus loaded with American college students is bombed in Rome, Harvath shifts into high gear. It's a horrific crime that can't go unanswered and Harvath is the man for the job. Clear across the world in Chicago, a second, less spectacular crime is committed--a seemingly random hit and run.\n\nHarvath is no stranger to violent terrorism or the fanatical minds behind it, but Harvath can't know the depth of the evil in play.\n\nIn a brutal pursuit that will test his knowledge of justice and mercy, Harvath must also confront his own inner demons, and they're as dangerous as the people he's pursuing. FOREIGN INFLUENCE rocks the house with Thor's best effort yet! We would expect nothing less from the New York Times #1 bestselling author of THE LAST PATRIOT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ec24b1a71c8c9ec2c1dbb8a6b31fc3d8cfd4c3","amp;dn":"Brad+Thor+-+Foreign+Influence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ec24b1a71c8c9ec2c1dbb8a6b31fc3d8cfd4c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,236,36,177,167,28,140,158,194,193,219,184,166,179,31,195,216,207,212,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
