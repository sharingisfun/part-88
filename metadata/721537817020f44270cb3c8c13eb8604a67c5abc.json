Allied and German survivors give their first-hand stories on the war that changed the course of the world. The long held belief that an Allied victory was secured after a single, bloody day will be dispelled. And the final death toll far exceeds anything seen on the beaches. D-Day remains one of the most important turning points of WWII, yet very few of us know the real story...until now\n\n\n                                         d$$$$$$$$$$$c        ,c,\n                                        $$$$$$$$$$$$$b     ,d$$$L\n                                      c$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$b ,,d$$$$$$,\n                                   ,d$$$$$$$$$$$$?$$$$$$$J$$$$$$$$b    .\n                                  cF',,$$$$?$$$$$$`$$$$$$$$$$$$b&quot;$$$bcc$P\n                                ,d3$$$$$$$$$$c`?$$$ ?$$$$$$$$$$$&quot;  &quot;????&quot;\n                               ,dP&quot;&quot;&quot;$$$$$$$$$$$;$$$  `?$$$$$$$$&quot;\n  .eu wanted                  ,$&quot;,zc$$$$$$P&quot;&quot;&quot;?$$$$P     &quot;?$$$F\n                             J$$d$$$$$$$$$$b. ,$$$$F\n                            d$P&quot;&quot;$$$$$$$$$$$&gt;d$$$$$\n                .,,,cccccccd$$c$cJ$$5$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n              c$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&quot;&quot;&quot;P'$$c ?$$$$$$$$$F\n             $$$$$$&quot;)$$$$$$$$$$d$c`$$$$$z$$$$$$$dC\n             $$$$$$,c?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$b,\n             &quot;$$$$$$$b,?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$cF&quot;$$$$$$$$$$$$$c\n               &quot;$$$$$$$bc,&quot;?$$$$$$$$$$$&quot; cc&quot;$$$$$$$$$$$$$c\n                 `&quot;?$$$$$$$c  &quot;&quot;&quot;??&quot;&quot;.,c$$$b$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,\n                    &quot;$c$$$$$         J$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n             .,cc$$cc`$b?$$$F..   ..,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n           cd$$$$$$$$,?$b`$$$,`:::',$$$$$$$$P&quot;.,.`&quot;$$$$$P&quot;\n        ,c$$$$$$$$$$P$ $$b`$$$c,``,$$$$3$$$&quot;,$$$$$c`&quot;&quot;\n       c$$$$$$$$$$$$L?,?$$b ?$$$$$$$$F,$$$&quot;,$$$$$$$c\n     ,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$?$ $$$$,&quot;$$$$$P&quot;d$$$ J$$$$$$$$$,\n   ,$$$$$$$$$?$$$$$$$ $ ?$$$$$c,,,,c$$$$FJ$$$$$$$$$$$\n ,d$$$$$$$$$&quot;d$$$$$$$ $L`$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Fd$$$$$$$$$$$L\n $$$$$$$$$$F.$$$$$$$$ $$ ?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$;$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n $$$$$$$$$$ d$$$$$$$$ $$,`$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$L\n $$$$$$$$$&quot;4$$$$$$$$$ $$$ $$$$$$$$$$$?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n $$$$$$&quot;$$.$$$$$$$$$$ $$$,`$$$$$$$$$'d$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$h\n $$$$$$&lt;$F,$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$,`$$$$$$$'d$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n $$$$$$&lt;$ $$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$,`$$$$&quot;,$$$$3$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$h\n $$$$$$'F&lt;$$$$$$$$$$$ ?$$$$$c,&quot;&quot;,d$$$$'$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721537817020f44270cb3c8c13eb8604a67c5abc","amp;dn":"D-Day.Lost.Films.2014.Part.1.DVDRip.X264-GHOULS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721537817020f44270cb3c8c13eb8604a67c5abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,21,55,129,112,32,244,66,112,203,60,140,19,235,134,4,166,124,90,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
