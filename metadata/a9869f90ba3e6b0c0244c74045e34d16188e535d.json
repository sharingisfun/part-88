Her job? Dragging kids out of virtual reality and back to their parents in the real world. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s normally easy cash, but NixyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest mission is fraught with real danger, intrigue, and romance.\n\nNixy Bauer is used to her classmates being very, very unhappy to see her. After all, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bounty hunter in a virtual reality gaming world. Kids in the MEEP, as they call it, play entirely with their minds, while their bodies languish in a sleeplike state on the couch. Irritated parents, looking to wrench their kids back to reality, hire Nixy to jump into the game and retrieve them. \n\nBut when the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s billionaire developer loses track of his own son in the MEEP, Nixy is in for the biggest challenge of her bounty-hunting career. Wyn Salvador isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t some lazy kid looking to escape his homework: Wyn does not want to be found. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left behind a suicide note. Nixy takes the job but quickly discovers that WynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not hidingÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being held inside the game against his will. But who is holding him captive, and why?\n\nNixy and Wyn attempt to fight their way out of a mind game unlike any theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve encountered, and the battle brings them closer than either could have imagined. But when the whole world is virtual, how can Nixy possibly know if her feelings are real?\n\nGamers and action fans of all types will dive straight into the MEEP, thanks to Julia DurangoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cinematic storytelling. A touch of romance adds some heart to NixyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid, multidimensional journey through WynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tricked-out virtual city, and constant twists keep readers flying through to the breathtaking end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9869f90ba3e6b0c0244c74045e34d16188e535d","amp;dn":"The+Leveller+-+Julia+Durango","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9869f90ba3e6b0c0244c74045e34d16188e535d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,134,159,144,186,62,107,12,2,68,199,64,69,227,77,22,24,142,83,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
