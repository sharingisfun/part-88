It comprises about 119 pages and was published originally in 1942 in French as Le Mythe de Sisyphe; the English translation by Justin O'Brien followed in 1955.\n\nIn the essay, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd: man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers: &quot;No. It requires revolt.&quot; He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes, &quot;The struggle itself [...] is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc72a0577db0507a52ef2d170b601e5092237ab","amp;dn":"Albert+Camus+-+The+Myth+Of+Sisyphus+And+Other+Essays.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc72a0577db0507a52ef2d170b601e5092237ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,199,42,5,119,219,5,7,165,46,242,209,112,182,1,229,9,34,55,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
