He is enthusiastic about what he does and has fond memories of the games he played as a child. Lately, he is forever talking about his childhood, obsessing in fact, over those little childhood moments that brought him great joy. His mother however doesn't quite remember their time living on Randolph St. as such a great time in their lives. He goes to visit his old neighborhood but when he gets there, he seems to have stepped back in time. He returns to the street several times and the scene repeats itself over and over. He realizes his childhood wasn't the wonderful time he remembered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251453749a40ee74b162170c778c59055cef24a1","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+The+Incredible+World+Of+Horace+Ford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251453749a40ee74b162170c778c59055cef24a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,20,83,116,154,64,238,116,177,98,23,12,119,140,89,5,92,239,36,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
