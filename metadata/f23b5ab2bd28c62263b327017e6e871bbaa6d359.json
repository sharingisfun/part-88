Stax died, but it's music will live forever. Right on.\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U\nCovers: Front Back CD\nTags: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\n\n\n\nSee 'Files:' for track list","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f23b5ab2bd28c62263b327017e6e871bbaa6d359","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Stax-Volt+Soul+Singles+Vol+3+1972-1975+%28MP3%40320%29+%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f23b5ab2bd28c62263b327017e6e871bbaa6d359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,59,90,178,189,40,198,34,99,179,39,1,126,110,135,27,186,166,211,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
