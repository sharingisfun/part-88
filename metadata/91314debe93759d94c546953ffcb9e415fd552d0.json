The latest updates only makes it better.\n\nTested this in P3D v2, seems to be working OK, so an option for P3D v2 were added as well when patching &amp; rebuilding the original v1.2 installer. However, NO warranty is provided for P3D v2 compatibility on your computer. Try this in P3D v2 at your own risk.\n\nSEED &amp; ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91314debe93759d94c546953ffcb9e415fd552d0","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+IRIS+Pro+Series+Christen+Eagle+v1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91314debe93759d94c546953ffcb9e415fd552d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,49,77,235,233,55,89,217,76,84,105,83,255,203,158,65,95,213,82,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
