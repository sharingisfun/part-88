Not all of their number have returned though and it is a bitter-sweet celebration. The festivities are interrupted when an elite force of CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thralls find their hidden home and attack.\n\nThe fallout from the nuclear plant is also creeping south with the prevailing winds forcing the humans to abandon their home. While they prepare to leave the weather worsens and they are forced to abandon many of their belonging and trek miles to what they hope will be a better life. Carter now knows where they are, though, and mounts a huge offensive to destroy the human threat and gain possession of the new, vampire-killing ammunition.\n\nCaught between the approaching thrall army, the violent storms and the poisoned air the humans make a desperate journey along the trail of tears.\n\nIn California Von Richelieu must re assert his authority over the cabals or lose everything. The small rebel band become more than a nuisance and Von Richelieu puts plans in place to destroy them once and for all.\n\nThe clock for the serumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly effects finally winds down and humans die in their thousands. With food scarce and the vampires falling prey to their growing madness the world falls closer to its apocalyptic end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defdf4ba233710e7ad225e70dcc1ac33696e89f7","amp;dn":"%5BVampire+Apocalypse+04%5D+Trail+of+Tears+by+Derek+Gunn+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defdf4ba233710e7ad225e70dcc1ac33696e89f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,253,244,186,35,55,16,231,173,34,94,112,220,193,172,51,105,110,137,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
