But fear turned to anger as rebellion grew in the hearts of men Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until the dawn of the Great Rising, when the fight for freedom began. After a glorious victory that cast aside the Fallen God, humans dictated a new orderÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a world where no sin can ever be forgiven and redemption was not an option.\nNow, millennia later, the world trembles in fear as the Demonic Rhogar Legion returns from their dark realm, driven by a foul hunger for innocent spirits. Humanity, in a desperate last act, calls upon an unlikely defender Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a convicted sinner, rejected by society and cast out of the lightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ a man known as Harkyn. Now, alongside his mentor, Kaslo, they must travel to the source of the DarknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ to face the Lords of the Fallen.\nPlunge into a fast paced action RPG with a complex and satisfying melee combat system where weapons, armor and skills directly influence the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speed and attacksÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if all else fails, lay waste to your foes using forbidden magic power.\n\nFEATURES\n\nEmbark on an Epic Quest that spans both human and demonic realms\nConfront the mighty Lords, generals of the Rhogar army\nExplore a vast dark fantasy world\nMake your choices wisely as they may seal your fate\nWield legendary weapons and armors from a vast arsenal\nChoose your class: Warrior, Cleric or Rogue and fully customize each with skills and weapons\n\nTitle: Lords Of The Fallen\nGenre: Action, RPG\nDeveloper: CI Games , Deck 13\nPublisher: CI Games\nRelease Date: Oct 28, 2014\n\nMinimum:\nOS: Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1) or Windows 8 (only 64 bit OSs\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400 @ 2.66Ghz or AMD Phenom II X4 940 @ 3.0Ghz\nMemory: 6 GB RAM\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 460 or better\nDirectX: Version 11\nHard Drive: 25 GB available space\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card with Latest Drivers\n\nRecommended:\nOS: Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1) or Windows 8 (only 64 bit OSs\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-3770 @3.5 GHz or AMD FX-8350 X8 @ 4 GHz\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 560 ti or better\nDirectX: Version 11\nHard Drive: 25 GB available space\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card with Latest Drivers\n\n    Instructions:\n\n           -Burn or mount the image\n           -Install the game\n           -Copy the crack to your game dir\n           -Enjoy\n\n           Notes:\n\n           - The game is updated to the latest patch (1.6) and includes all DLCs,\n           - To change language, follow instructions inside CPY.ini \n\n\n[img]http://s9.postimg.org/xbrj34x9b/scr1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://s9.postimg.org/nh0dwwtb3/scr2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://s9.postimg.org/z7ebeam3j/scr3.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://s9.postimg.org/lb632epun/scr4.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38ea225f3f01c7e7f7812a715058ea9625ca817b","amp;dn":"Lords.Of.The.Fallen-DLC-CPY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38ea225f3f01c7e7f7812a715058ea9625ca817b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,234,34,95,63,1,199,231,247,129,42,113,80,88,234,150,37,202,129,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
