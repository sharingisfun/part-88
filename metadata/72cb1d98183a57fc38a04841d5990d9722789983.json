Championed by The Beatles, she began her career as a singer in 1963, and her singles &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; (1964) and &quot;You're My World&quot; (1964) both reached number one. Black had eleven Top Ten hits on the British charts between 1964 and 1971. In May 2010 new research published by BBC Radio 2 showed that her version of &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; was the UK's biggest selling single by a female artist in the 1960s.[1] &quot;You're My World&quot; was also a modest hit in the US, peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAlong with a successful recording career in the 1960s and early 1970s, Black hosted her own eponymous variety show, Cilla, for the BBC between 1968 and 1976. After a brief time as a comedy actress in the mid-1970s, she became a prominent television presenter in the 1980s and 1990s, hosting hit entertainment shows such as Blind Date (1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003) and Surprise Surprise (1984Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001).\n \n\n\nCilla's Comedy Six\n \nSeries of individual sitcom plays starring Cilla Black as a range of strong female characters\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cillas_comedy_six/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cillas_comedy_six/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\nCilla's Comedy Six - S01 - (6x30 Minutes)\n\n\n\n\n \n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Cilla's Comedy Six.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 25mn 9s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 945 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 25mn 9s\nBitrate                     : 1 831 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.245\nStream size                 : 330 MB (94%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 25mn 9s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 100 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 18.1 MB (5%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 516 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cb1d98183a57fc38a04841d5990d9722789983","amp;dn":"Cilla%27s+%28Cilla+Black%29+Comedy+Six+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cb1d98183a57fc38a04841d5990d9722789983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,203,29,152,24,58,87,252,56,160,72,65,213,153,13,151,34,120,153,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
