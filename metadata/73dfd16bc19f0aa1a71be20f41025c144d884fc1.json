Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk presents a state-of the-art perspective on this particular issue.\n\nSupply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk demonstrates that effective management of supply disruptions necessitates both strategic and tactical measures Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the former involving optimal design of supply networks; the latter involving inventory, finance and demand management. It shows that managers ought to use all available levers at their disposal throughout the supply network Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like sourcing and pricing strategies, providing financial subsidies, encouraging information sharing and incentive alignment between supply chain partners Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in order to tackle supply disruptions. The editors combine up-to-date academic research with the latest operational risk management practices used in industry to demonstrate how theoreticians and practitioners can learn from each other.\n\nAs well as providing a wealth of knowledge for students and professors who are interested in pursuing research or teaching courses in the rapidly growing area of supply chain risk management, Supply Chain Disruptions: Theory and Practice of Managing Risk also acts as a ready reference for practitioners who are interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of effective supply disruption management techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dfd16bc19f0aa1a71be20f41025c144d884fc1","amp;dn":"Supply+Chain+Disruptions+-+Theory+and+Practice+of+Managing+Risk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dfd16bc19f0aa1a71be20f41025c144d884fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,223,209,107,193,159,10,161,167,27,226,15,65,2,92,20,77,136,79,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
