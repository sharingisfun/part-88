Sreekumar, P.V. SreenIvasaiah, &quot;Small Scale Livestock Production&quot;\n\n2015 | ASIN: B010CGJO1M | 207 pages | EPUB | 1 MB\n\nThis book is primarily aimed to help livestock farmer with basic data regarding scientific production of milk (Cattle and Buffaloes) and meat (Sheep, Goats and Rabbits) in a small scale. Not many publications are available to provide answers to several doubts the farmers are likely to get on day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ day basis, especially to suit Indian conditions. Number of publications is available on livestock production; but most of them are too descriptive and of standards which ordinary farmers may find difficult to understand. Therefore, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AnswerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ method is employed wherever appropriate with maximum emphasis on practical aspects to facilitate comprehension; scientific reasons are made as simple as possible to help literate farmers understand the basics. The book includes separate Sections on Cattle and Buffaloes, Sheep and Goats, Pigs and Rabbits; each section has details of selection of herd / flock, management, feeding, disease control and economics. Housing, Sanitation and disinfection, Record keeping and Waste management, which are common to all Sections, are provided as appendices. It is hoped that this publication would be useful as a handy ready reckoner for farmers who would like to start livestock farming with small number of animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2777d0a4f6b4c38a3cb43951ead10bd1b66196","amp;dn":"Small+Scale+Livestock+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2777d0a4f6b4c38a3cb43951ead10bd1b66196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,39,119,208,164,246,180,195,138,60,180,57,81,234,209,11,209,182,97,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
