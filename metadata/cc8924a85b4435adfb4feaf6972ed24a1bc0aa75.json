If there are no subs in your required language it is because there were none on the DvD and I was unable to procure a DvD with those Subs.\n\n\n\nIngenting har lagts till eller tagits bort ÃƒÂ¤r det som jag fick den. Om det inte finns nÃƒÂ¥gra subs i ditt ÃƒÂ¶nskat sprÃƒÂ¥k ÃƒÂ¤r det fÃƒÂ¶r att det fanns ingen pÃƒÂ¥ DVD och jag kunde inte skaffa en DVD med dessa Subs\n\n\n\nNiets is toegevoegd of weggenomen is als ik hem ontving. Als er geen subs in uw gewenste taal is het omdat er geen waren op de DVD en ik was niet in staat om een Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹DVD te kopen met die Subs.\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\n\nPAL\n\n\n1751 x 4MB packets \n\n\nInitial Seeding Process Used\n\n\n\nEnter the Dragon revolves around the three main characters. Lee, a man recruited by an agency to investigate a tournament hosted by Han, since they believe he has an Opium trade there. Roper and Williams are former army buddies since Vietnam and they enter the tournament due to different problems that they have. Roper is on the run from the Mafia due to his gambling debts, while Williams is harassed by racist police officers and defends himself from them and uses the car for his getaway.
