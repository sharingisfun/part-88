Written by environmental expert Frank Spellman, Forest-Based Biomass Energy: Concepts and Applications details how forest biomass can be converted to energy and energy products, including direct combustion, pellets, gasification, and co-firing. It explores the possibilities of forest-based biomass energy for producing a reliable energy renewable energy source that will not destroy or pollute our fragile environment.\n\nCarefully avoiding the influence of media hype and political ideology, Spellman points out that every problem has a solution, we simply need to find sources and develop them. He delineates common-sense approaches and practical, sometimes poetic, examples. And he does all this while adhering to scientific principles, models, and observations. However, you need not be a scientist to understand the principles and concepts. Spellman goes easy on the hard math and science and presents the material in a user-friendly manner, weaving real-life situations throughout the fabric of the text.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOffers complete coverage of forest biomass, rather than simply touching on one source\nIncludes several basic and practical mathematical operations illustrated with example problems and explained solutions\nExamines numerous types of tree stocks\nContains information on silviculture\nAddresses growing transportation energy needs and limited petroleum resources\nOffers information on the benefits of Agroforestry\nThis is not merely an answer book; it is designed to stimulate thought and new ideas. Although the author answers specific renewable energy and forest-derived feedstock questions, he also points out the disadvantages that need to be overcome to make forest-based renewable energy a viable alternative to fossil fuels. He provides a framework of principles you can use to understand the complexity of the situation of substituting a renewable energy source, such as forest-based biomass, for fossil fuels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba8aa3c7cadadb6dd70607628b545bb2be7ce5d","amp;dn":"Forest-Based+Biomass+Energy+-+Concepts+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba8aa3c7cadadb6dd70607628b545bb2be7ce5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,168,170,60,124,173,173,182,221,112,96,118,40,181,69,187,43,231,206,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
