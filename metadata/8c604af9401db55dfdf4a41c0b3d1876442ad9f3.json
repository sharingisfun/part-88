At about the same time, a single, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. The North American version of the album on Elektra Records added &quot;Indian Summer&quot; as the opening track, along with &quot;It Brings A Tear&quot; which had already appeared on the UK album Friend's Friend's Friend. The Elektra LP dropped the song &quot;Eye To Eye&quot;.\n\nBoth the UK and North American LPs were originally issued as gatefold. The UK gatefold contains black-and-white photos of each band member. The Elektra Records gatefold contains the album lyrics with a photo of the &quot;house on the hill&quot; in the background. The Elektra LP was later reissued in the early 1980s, non-gatefold.\n\nThe 1991 Virgin Records UK CD release, issued in the U.S. on Caroline Records, used the British LP track listing, adding the single &quot;Indian Summer&quot; to the end of the album. The Elektra Records version of The House On The Hill has never been issued on CD.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------\nPersonnel:\n----------\nTony Connor: drums, percussion and vibes\nTrevor Williams: bass guitar and vocals\nHoward Werth: electric classical guitar and vocals\nKeith Gemmell: tenor saxophone, recorder, clarinet and flute\nRobert Kirby: string arrangement and conducting for &quot;Raviole&quot;\nMembers Of The London Symphony Orchestra: strings on &quot;Raviole&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c604af9401db55dfdf4a41c0b3d1876442ad9f3","amp;dn":"Audience%2FThe+House+On+The+Hill+%5B1971%2F2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c604af9401db55dfdf4a41c0b3d1876442ad9f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,96,74,249,64,29,181,93,253,244,164,28,11,61,24,118,68,42,217,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
