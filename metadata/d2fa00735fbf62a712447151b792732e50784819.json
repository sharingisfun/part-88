They might be beginners, or they may have already owned and used an astronomical telescope for a year or more.\n\nNewcomers are almost always wowed by sights such as the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter, but have little idea how to find these objects for themselves (with the obvious exceptions of the Sun and Moon). They also need guidance about what equipment, besides a telescope, they will need.\n\nThis book is written by an expert on the Solar System, who has had a lot of experience with outreach programs, which teach others how to make the most of relatively simple and low-cost equipment. That does not mean that this book is not for serious amateurs. On the contrary, it is designed to show amateur astronomers, in a relatively light-heartedÃ¢â‚¬â€and math-free wayÃ¢â‚¬â€how to become serious","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fa00735fbf62a712447151b792732e50784819","amp;dn":"Viewing+and+Imaging+the+Solar+System%3A+A+Guide+for+Amateur+Astron","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fa00735fbf62a712447151b792732e50784819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,250,0,115,95,191,98,167,18,68,113,81,183,146,115,46,80,120,72,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
