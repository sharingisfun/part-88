Denise MacGregor knows all too well what lurks in the shadowsÃ¢â‚¬â€her best friend is half-vampire Cat CrawfieldÃ¢â‚¬â€and she has already lost more than the average human could bear. But her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past is wrapped in secrets and shrouded in darknessÃ¢â‚¬â€and a demon shape-shifter has marked Denise as prey. Now her survival depends on an immortal who lusts for a taste of her.\n\nHe is Spade, a powerful, mysterious vampire who has walked the earth for centuries and is now duty-bound to protect this endangered, alluring humanÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means destroying his own kind. Denise may arouse his deepest hungers, but Spade knows he must fight his urge to have her as they face the nightmare together, because once the first crimson drop falls, they will both be lost","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543830b281fef1dd731aa6f4f0982ca518c82d86","amp;dn":"First+Drop+of+Crimson+-+Jeaniene+Frost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543830b281fef1dd731aa6f4f0982ca518c82d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,56,48,178,129,254,241,221,115,26,166,244,240,152,44,165,24,200,45,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
