Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nRISKY BUSINESS: What's most likely to kill you? ISIS? Not likely.\n\nMost people are killed by ordinary things: 5,000 Americans die crossing the street, 4,000 people drown, 300 drown in bathtubs, more than 4,000 Americans choke to death every year, 2,000 die in house fires, stairs kill 1,000 Americans, and every year, 50 children are killed by ordinary, five-gallon buckets. Terrorism kills but (so far) it poses a much smaller threat. Even if 3,000 Americans died every few years, such attacks would be less deadly than choking or drowning.\n\nTHE GAME OF RISK: What's riskier-walking through an airport scanner or eating a handful of Brazil nuts? The answer might surprise you. I play a new game on my show: Can Fox TV hosts Harris Faulkner, David Asman, and Judge Jeanine Pirro figure out what's riskier than what?\n\nFORCED VACCINATIONS: Contagious disease is a special case that justifies government intervention. Stossel thinks parents who don't vaccinate their kids are anti-scientific morons. But since zero Americans have died of measles, it is not yet right for the state to force vaccination.\n\nSAFETY VS. FREEDOM: Motorcycles are very dangerous. So should the government force bikers to wear helmets? 19 states do. We libertarians say, that's wrong. Once I'm an adult... I should get to take my own chances, even if I'm a fool. As Milton Friedman said, &quot;Part of freedom is the freedom to be a fool.&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: In America, thanks to free enterprise, life is pretty good. And every year, Americans live longer.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.03.06.Life.Or.Death.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 185 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f82bc0c1ca78d2fe75bdc3da2f02ad4dd8a88441","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.03.06.Life.Or.Death.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f82bc0c1ca78d2fe75bdc3da2f02ad4dd8a88441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,43,192,193,202,120,210,254,117,189,195,218,47,2,173,77,216,168,132,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
