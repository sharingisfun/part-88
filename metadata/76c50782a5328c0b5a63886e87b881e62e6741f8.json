Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c50782a5328c0b5a63886e87b881e62e6741f8","amp;dn":"The+Forest+v0.07+%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c50782a5328c0b5a63886e87b881e62e6741f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,197,7,130,165,50,140,11,90,99,136,110,135,184,129,230,46,103,65,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
