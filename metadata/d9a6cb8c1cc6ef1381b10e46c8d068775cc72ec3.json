Given the British weather and its rural setting, what will our reviewers think of a holiday at home?\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/08/25/11449d20fb49ab92a4a9d732b0a1563a.jpg[/img]\n\nThis year its estimated that three quarters of us Brits will holiday at home in the UK, so our travel guides are visiting the Lake District to get the lowdown on what a week long caravan holiday there offers. Situated in the North West of England, the Lake District is BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest outdoor playground and attracts over 15 million tourists from around the world each year. But with the notorious British weather and its rural surrounds, will our reviewers really think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to holiday at home or away? \n \nThe Boyles from Dorset start the trip with great expectations. Having never visited the area they are wowed by the jaw dropping scenery on offer. However itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before they question if a small caravan is enough to accommodate their lively brood of kids. Honor Chapman-Blackwell and her boyfriend Jonjo think a holiday in the Lakes is just for Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬â„¢coffin dodgersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, and a trip to Keswick pencil museum does nothing to convince them otherwise. In the Brearley family Simon and Jayne face an uphill battle convincing son Ben that hiking up a hill is more beneficial than viewing it at home on google maps and a trip to a local climbing centre nearly spells disaster for model Riah. As she clings to the cliff edge she declare this to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬â„¢the worst holiday ever!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a6cb8c1cc6ef1381b10e46c8d068775cc72ec3","amp;dn":"Travel.Guides.s01e04.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a6cb8c1cc6ef1381b10e46c8d068775cc72ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,166,203,140,28,198,239,19,129,177,14,70,200,208,104,119,92,199,46,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
