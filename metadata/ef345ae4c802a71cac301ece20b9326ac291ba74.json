It takes readily available government and international statistics to provide insight into how businesses and economists can interpret the factors that influence the growth of power intensive industries. It also discusses the CarbFix and SulFix projects that involve the injection of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), and carbon dioxide (CO2) back to reservoir as an emission reduction method. With improved engineering processes, both types of power generation are increasingly subject to economies of scale. These exciting technological developments have a great potential to change the way the world works, as the economy continues to rely so heavily on energy to drive production. Green energy is without a question going to be a major factor in our future, so studying it at its nascence is particularly exciting. This book is intended for academic researchers and students interested in current economic and environmental hot topics, as well as people interested in the inner workings of a possible new investment opportunity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef345ae4c802a71cac301ece20b9326ac291ba74","amp;dn":"Economics+and+Power-intensive+Industries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef345ae4c802a71cac301ece20b9326ac291ba74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,52,90,228,200,2,167,28,172,48,30,206,32,185,50,106,194,145,186,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
