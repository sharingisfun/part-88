As a collection of Sylvian's instrumental work, it blends together very well- though anyone who didn't enjoy his other instrumental work (the Czuckay albums Flux&amp;Mutability/Plight&amp;Premonition, the last sides of Gone to Earth) may not be that enamoured.\n\nThe three-part Words With the Shaman-suite is particularly wonderful- Part1: Ancient Evening, Part 2: Incantation &amp; Part 3: Awakening (Songs from the Tree Tops) find Sylvian and brother Jansen advancing on the Brilliant Trees collaboration with Holger Czuckay and Jon Hassell. \n\nIf played directly after listening to Hassell/Sylvian's co-written song Brilliant Trees, it makes complete sense. Words with the Shaman is as strong as Eno/Byrne's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts or Philip Glass' Powaqqatsi. Preperation for a Journey &amp; Steel Cathedrals extend on this, but have been seen by many people as I know as extremly indulgent- personally I think they've dated well and are in need of reassessment. It's nice to hear a blend of ambient, world music and jazz coming together- could this be a post-Eno Filles De Kilimanjaro?.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Words With The Shaman - Part 1 Ancient Evening\n02 - Words With The Shaman - Part 2 Incantation\n03 - Words With The Shaman - Part 3 Awakening (Songs From The Treetops)\n04 - Preparations For A Journey\n05 - The Stigma Of Childhood (Kin)\n06 - A Brief Conversation Ending In Divorce\n07 - Steel Cathedrals\n\n*2006 Virgin Remaster / EMI | 0946 363067 2 8\n\n\nPersonnel:\nDavid Sylvian / keyboards, guitar, tapes, digital percussion\nSteve Jansen / drums, percussion, additional keyboards\nJon Hassell / trumpet\nKenny Wheeler / flugelhorn\nHolger Czukay / radio, dictaphone\nRyuichi Sakamoto / piano, strings\nRobert Fripp / guitar, frippertronics\nMasami Tsuchiya / guitar\nPercy Jones / fretless bass\n\n\n\nDavid Sylvian - Brilliant Trees (1984) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11088946/David_Sylvian_-_Brilliant_Trees_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
