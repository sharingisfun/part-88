Ehrman takes the affirmative, Butt the negative.\n\nThe debate, which takes place on April 4, 2014, is sponsored by the Christian Student Center at the University of North Alabama and is produced Apologetics Press. Apologetics Press is a Christian organization whose purposes are defending the Christian faith and teaching on various Bible-related topics.\n\nThis upload is the complete video file of the debate. (I'll also upload the complete audio-only file.) The first about 28 minutes is pre-debate commentary by Apologetics Press and an introduction to the Christian Student Center at the University of North Alabama. The last about 21 minutes is post-debate commentary by Apologetics Press and interviews with Ehrman and Butt. There is no skeptic-based commentary on the debate.\n\nHere is the debate summary from the Apologetics Press website:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If there is a loving God, Who is powerful enough to stop suffering, why is there still such pain in the world?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Skeptics often use this question in their attempts to sow the seeds of doubt in the minds of those who hold to the Christian faith. In this debate, national best-selling author and self-professed agnostic, Bart Ehrhman, contends that the pain and suffering in the world show that the loving God of the Bible does not exist. Christian apologist Kyle Butt brings to light the evidence that refutes EhrmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contention, and shows that the pain and suffering in this world do not militate against the concept of an all-loving, all-powerful God.\n\nFor a comprehensive treatment of Bart Ehrman's view on suffering check out his New York Times bestselling book &quot;God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question--Why We Suffer&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d610e603e9046b4ed7975666a247873ba06b40e5","amp;dn":"Ehrman+-+Butt+Debate%3A+The+Pain+and+Suffering+in+the+World+Indica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d610e603e9046b4ed7975666a247873ba06b40e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,16,230,3,233,4,107,78,215,151,86,102,162,71,135,59,160,107,64,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
