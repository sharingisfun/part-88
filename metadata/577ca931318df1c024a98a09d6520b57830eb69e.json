It is the tenth Tomb Raider game, and the first in a new take on the series. Tomb Raider explores the intense and gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a frightened young woman to a hardened survivor. Armed only with raw instincts and the ability to push beyond the limits of human endurance, Lara must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island to escape its relentless hold. In April 2015, Square Enix announced that the game has shipped over 8.5 million units, making it the best selling entry in the franchise.\n\nInstallation:\nJust unzip and play!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:577ca931318df1c024a98a09d6520b57830eb69e","amp;dn":"Tomb+Raider+2013+MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"577ca931318df1c024a98a09d6520b57830eb69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,124,169,49,49,141,241,192,36,169,138,9,214,82,11,87,131,14,182,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
