The early Katatonia albums, along with albums by bands such as My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost, are sometimes considered forerunners of the death/doom genre.\n\nThe Great Cold Distance is Katatonia's seventh full-length album.\nThe album was recorded and mixed at Fascination Street Studios, Ãƒâ€“rebro. It is placed at number 8 on PopMatters' list of the Top Metal Albums of 2006.\nThe album was re-released on March 12, 2007 with two bonus tracks with the entire album in 5.1 surround sound.\nThere is also a special Swedish edition of the album, which came in a limited edition box with an exclusive Katatonia poster, set of Katatonia postcards and an enhanced video of &quot;My Twin&quot;.
