This book shows how. It would be nice if your happy chemicals just flowed all the time, but they were not designed for effortless happiness. Their job is to promote survival, though your brain defines survival in a quirky way. It cares about the survival of your genes, and it wires itself in youth. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we do quirky things to stimulate our happy chemicals, despite our best intentions. You can build new neural pathways to turn on your dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, and oxytocin in new ways","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed1985238bb663a2081319fe656070e5bac89783","amp;dn":"Meet+Your+Happy+Chemicals%3A+Dopamine%2C+Endorphin%2C+Oxytocin%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed1985238bb663a2081319fe656070e5bac89783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,25,133,35,139,182,99,162,8,19,25,254,101,96,112,229,186,200,151,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
