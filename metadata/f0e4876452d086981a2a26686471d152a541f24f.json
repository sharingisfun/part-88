But this is no ordinary tour. Each night when he steps on stage, Tommy will be improvising from scratch. No preparation. No routine. Each location is the edge of a cliff. Not one to sit back and coast, this tour will take Tommy out of his comfort zone and reconnect him to the energy and buzz of his early days as a rising comic almost 20 years ago. In each of the cities he performs, Tommy will be playing to a new audience. He can't rely on a 'home' crowd. The European audience will judge him on his material, on this performance alone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e4876452d086981a2a26686471d152a541f24f","amp;dn":"Tommy+To+Tell+You+The+Truth+HDTV+XviD-SPiNZES.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e4876452d086981a2a26686471d152a541f24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,228,135,100,82,208,134,152,26,42,38,104,100,113,209,82,165,65,242,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
