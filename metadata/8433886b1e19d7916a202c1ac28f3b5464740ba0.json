Here the latest version of Divinity: Original Sin. Im srry I been behind on the patches. Reason for that is because Gog was not releasing small patches for the mac version like they were doing for the PC version. They released a whole new installer with each new patch which meant me uploading and seeding 9 or 10GB of data every time a new patch was released. So im again very srry about the updates but I will really try to keep the mac version updated now.\n\nFor mac users who downloaded my previous torrent, uninstall that. Back up your saves first. That version is useless, you need to install the base game that included in this torrent.\n\n-------------------\n\n\nChangelog for version 1.0.177: \n\n\nFor the recent Mac OS update 10.9.5, we have released a hotfix that solves signature issues. \n\nWe seized this opportunity to also fix the combat log disappearing for some of you, and fix jumping journal entries. \n\nIf you load a savegame in which the combat log was gone, you may have to drag it above the skillbar to be able to resize it again. \n\nOn the Mac version, the GodRays effect was distorted and this was fixed as well. \n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8433886b1e19d7916a202c1ac28f3b5464740ba0","amp;dn":"Divinity+Original+Sin+%28Latest+With+1.0.177+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8433886b1e19d7916a202c1ac28f3b5464740ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,51,136,107,30,25,215,145,106,32,44,26,194,143,59,84,100,116,11,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
