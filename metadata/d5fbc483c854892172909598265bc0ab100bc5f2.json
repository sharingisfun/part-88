Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF THE MIND gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics. One day we might have a &quot;smart pill&quot; that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a &quot;brain-net&quot;; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe.\n\nDr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about &quot;consciousness&quot; and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness.\n\nWith Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, THE FUTURE OF THE MIND is a scientific tour de force--an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5fbc483c854892172909598265bc0ab100bc5f2","amp;dn":"The+Future+of+the+Mind+by+Michio+Kaku+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5fbc483c854892172909598265bc0ab100bc5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,251,196,131,200,84,137,33,114,144,149,152,38,91,192,171,16,11,197,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
