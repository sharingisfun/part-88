Also in the studio is Ryan Adams, who performs a couple of songs from his self-titled and self-produced 14th LP. West London collective Jungle bring their mesmeric, kaleidoscopic modern soul to the studio. Led by a musical duo known simply as J and T, they expand to a seven-piece live set-up to deliver a couple of tunes from their debut self-titled album. Jools is also joined by Tahliah Debrett Barnett, aka FKA twigs, who has just released debut album LP1. Legendary US R&amp;B singing group The O'Jays are joining Jools round the piano. And from Australia, singer-songwriter Vance Joy makes his debut on the show with his infectious global hit and UK top 10 single Riptide from his debut album Dream Your Life Away.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 3.93 GB\nRuntime___: 62 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps 7971Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 CBR 2ch 48KHz 192Kbps\nAudio#2___: MP2 CBR 2ch 48KHz 256Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75db3f5c889e3d03b897f5a8249bafcb4c519c42","amp;dn":"BBC.Later.with.Jools.Holland.S45E01.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75db3f5c889e3d03b897f5a8249bafcb4c519c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,219,63,92,136,158,61,3,184,151,245,168,36,155,175,203,76,81,156,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
