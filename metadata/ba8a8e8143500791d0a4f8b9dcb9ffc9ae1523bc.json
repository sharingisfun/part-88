Consisting mostly of covers of blues hits, it includes &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;, a medley of John Lee Hooker's &quot;House Rent Boogie&quot; and &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;, a song written by Rudy Toombs for Amos Milburn and later covered by Hooker as well. The song remains a fan favorite that is still played today.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe debut album by George Thorogood and the Destroyers exploded onto the FM airwaves in 1977, bringing a dose of hard-driving roots reality back to rock radio; his versions of Bo Diddley's 'Who Do You Love' and John Lee Hooker's 'One Bourbon One Scotch and One Beer' resonated throughout the years. Beginning his career as a solo act, Thorogood soon added drummer Jeff Simon and guitarist Ron Smith, and it was with this ensemble that George initially cut his first record a sound that was even more raw than the final version of the album, with George's propulsive performance, backed only by Jeff's ferocious drumming and Ron's steady low-strings-on-the-guitar underpinning. Eventually, new band member Billy Blough overdubbed his bass, which gave the album the sound it needed for radio airplay, and that's the version of the record we've all heard; until now. \n\nNow, thirty-eight years later, here is the first album by George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers (the 'Delaware' was later dropped), as it was initially recorded, newly mixed by legendary producer Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Pixies, Warren Zevon). In this stripped-down setting, the focus and drive of George's performance, which are what have always set him apart in the blues-rock world, are even more apparent. \n\nAs a bonus, the album includes previously unreleased track 'Goodbye Baby,' a cover of the Elmore James song. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------\nPersonnel:\n----------\n\nGeorge Thorogood: vocals, guitar, harmonica\nRon Smith: guitar\nBilly Blough: bass guitar\nJeff Simon: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8a8e8143500791d0a4f8b9dcb9ffc9ae1523bc","amp;dn":"George+Thorogood+%26amp%3B+The+Delaware+Destroyers+%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8a8e8143500791d0a4f8b9dcb9ffc9ae1523bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,138,142,129,67,80,7,145,208,164,248,185,220,185,255,201,174,21,35,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
