From Dr. Francis A. BoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s detailed legal case against the state of Israel, to Uri AvneryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slow Motion Ethnic Cleansing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Richard FalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slouching toward a Palestinian Holocaust,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ilan PappeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Genocide in Gaza,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ these voices decry in startling, vivid, and forceful language the calculated atrocities taking place, the inhumane conditions inflicted on the people, and the silence that exists despite the crimes, nothing short of state-sponsored genocide against the Palestinians. \n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Plight of the Palestinians turned out to be an essential read, and a full and authoritative discourse. It offers a grim and detailed story of suffering and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“slow motion genocideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is important in order to appreciate the harshness of the Palestinian experience. The Plight of the Palestinians: A Long History of Destruction spreads the seeds of understanding, which is so essential to any meaningful and lasting change.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--The Jordan Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In his collection of thirty-two articles by almost as many authorsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦William Cook provides a devastating assessment of Zionist violence against Palestinians. Relentlessly told are one atrocity after another, one act of deception after another, one broken treaty after another, one surprise attack after another, one policy reversal after another--all of which are described with both effective immediacy and an adequate sense of historic context.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--Atlantic Free Press\nAbout the Author\n\nWilliam A. Cook is Professor of English at the University of La Verne in southern California where he served for 13 years as Vice President for Academic Affairs before assuming his faculty position in 2001. Prior to coming to California, he served as a Dean of Faculty, Chair of Department of English and faculty member at institutions large and small, public and private in four eastern states. He is an activist and a writer for numerous Internet publications including Counterpunch, Pacific Free Press in British Columbia, Dissident Voice and Information Clearing House, serving as senior editor for MWC News out of Canada, and contributing editor at the Palestine Chronicle, the Atlantic Free Press in the Netherlands, and the World Prout Assembly, his polemics against the Bush administration and the atrocities caused by Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert in Israel, now our 51st state, have been spread around the Internet world and translated into French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Italian. Cook also serves on the Board of the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Media Project, interviews on radio and TV in South Africa, Canada, Iran and the United States and contributed for five years yearly predictions to the Hong Kong Economic News. This volume follows his Tracking Deception: Bush Mid-East Policy, Hope Destroyed, Justice Denied: The Rape of Palestine and continues his scourge against the hypocrisy, deceit, and destructive policies that have characterized American mid-east policy and its destructive alliance with the Zionist forces that have turned Israel into an apartheid state determined to destroy the Palestinian people. In addition to his polemics, he writes plays (The Unreasoning Mask, co-authored with his wife, DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Arcy, and The Agony of Colin Powell), satires (see Ã¢â‚¬Å“Advancing the Civilized State: Inch by Bloody InchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in The Rape), and poetry (Psalms for the 21st Century). His most recent fictional work creates a morality tale based upon real life figures that haunt our lives, The Chronicles of Nefaria.
