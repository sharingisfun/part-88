Rich absolutely rips Ant's &quot;live audience&quot; apart, Vos defends his right to own German cars, Ant defends his multi-cultural friends, and Vos destroys the &quot;live audience&quot; once again. Unfortunately the feed goes down (get your shit together Rat!!) but when it's back up, the boys examine the social commentary that led to Ant's firing and we learn how contract negotiations really go down at SiriusXM. They discuss what the aftermath could have been if Ant apologized, watch a few &quot;Classic Moments in Cinema with Colin Quinn,&quot; Colin calls to chime in, and they chat about Rich and Bonnie's movie &quot;Women Aren't Funny.&quot; They debate men versus women in comedy, Joe DeRosa, we learn that Anthony will be on Joe Rogan's podcast October 10th, the brave boys take a few listener calls, and Ticket University helps @SteveBawbee to be unblocked.\n\n\n**Technical issues plagued todays show...Im thinking it was Vos drool. This is why there are 2 videos for todays show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67b608ada63f7c18153738393c93393459e592dc","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67b608ada63f7c18153738393c93393459e592dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,182,8,173,166,63,124,24,21,55,56,57,60,147,57,52,89,229,146,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
