But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them. \n\n----------------\n\nSample included\n\n----------------\n\nEnjoy\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca21d5de1ac3112a9940abf5f5d7ccd85c54db83","amp;dn":"22.Jump.Street.2014.HDrip.x264-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca21d5de1ac3112a9940abf5f5d7ccd85c54db83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,33,213,222,26,195,17,42,153,64,171,245,245,215,204,216,92,84,219,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
