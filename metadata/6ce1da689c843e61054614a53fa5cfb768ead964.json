However, instead of handling the processes within the virtual machine as other virtualization products do to render 3D graphics, Parallels Workstation Extreme uses Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O to direct the multimedia directly back to the hostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s graphics cards while NvidiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SLI Multi-OS allows the host machine and the virtual machine to each have their dedicated GPU. Each graphic application running in a virtual machine requires its own dedicated Nvidia Quadro FX 3800, 4800, or 5800 graphics card, which are the only graphics cards currently supported by the product.\n\nTo provide the hardware environment to support this mix of virtualization and graphics technologies, Hewlett-Packard partnered with Parallels and Nvidia to develop the HP Z800, a high-end PC that include NvidiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quadro FX GPUs and Intel's VT-d and Xeon processor.\n\nFeatures\nParallels Workstation Extreme includes support for up to 16 CPU cores, 64 GB of RAM for guest OSs, 16 virtual network adapters per virtual machine and virtual drive sizes up to 2 TB. Users can use multiple monitors, display a different guest operating system in each screen and also move the mouse back and forth between monitors and OSs. Parallels Workstation Extreme load balances CPU resources as users move between the different OSs on the workstation.\n\nThe product also supports CLI, PXEboot and USB 2.0 devices. Users can utilize virtual machine templates, multiple snapshot capabilities and software development kits. Also included is Parallels Compressor, designed to compress the size of a virtual hard disk, and Parallels Image Tool, designed to increase or decrease the size of a virtual hard disk.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\n2.6.32\n\n\n\nHost requirements include:\n\n64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 host operating system\n1 or 2 Intel Xeon Processors 5500 series\n8 GB RAM\n10 GB disk space per virtual machine\nSupported NVIDIA Quadro FX graphics cards\n\n\n\nWorking on most 2.6.32 with linux-headers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce1da689c843e61054614a53fa5cfb768ead964","amp;dn":"Parallels+Workstation+Extreme+6.0+%2B+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce1da689c843e61054614a53fa5cfb768ead964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,225,218,104,156,132,62,97,5,70,20,165,63,165,207,183,104,234,217,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
