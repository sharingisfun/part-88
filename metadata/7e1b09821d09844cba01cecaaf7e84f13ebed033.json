The first story is a romantic triangle with Charles \n      Boyer, Rita Hayworth, and Thomas Mitchell. The coat moves to another owner, a fanciful \n      tale featuring Henry Fonda, Ginger Rogers, and Cesar Romero. The coat is next bought \n      by Elsa Lanchester for her (real-life) husband, Charles Laughton, playing a \n      down-on-his-luck musician and composer. It then comes into the possession of a \n      disbarred lawyer, Edward G. Robinson who meets a classmate, George Sanders, at a very \n      elegant college reunion. The coat is taken by two gangsters who lose it, and found \n      by the very poorest of the poor, the Black community of the depression-racked 1930's, \n      played by famed singer Paul Robeson and the great Ethel Waters, who go to their \n      pastor, Eddie Rochester Anderson, with whom the coat finally brings something good.\n   \n     Group Info  \n                                                                                           \n      Our mission is to provide the scene with decent quality rips of old TV classics.     \n                                                                                           \n      Greets fly out to ARCHiViST, GERUDO, INQUISITION, RedBlade, REWARD, and everyone     \n      that helped us; you know who you guys are!                                           \n                                                                                           \n      Looking for decent affil sites (no rented/colo) and rippers/cappers.                 \n                                                                                           \n      Ask around for us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1b09821d09844cba01cecaaf7e84f13ebed033","amp;dn":"Tales.Of.Manhattan.1942.DVDRip.x264-PHOBOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1b09821d09844cba01cecaaf7e84f13ebed033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,27,9,130,29,9,132,76,186,1,206,202,175,126,132,241,62,190,208,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
