(mobi, epub)\n\n\nMillions of people meditate daily but can meditative practices really make us Ã¢â‚¬ËœbetterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ people?\n \nIn The Buddha Pill, pioneering psychologists Dr Miguel Farias and Catherine Wikholm put meditation and mindfulness under the microscope. Separating fact from fiction, they reveal what scientific research--including their groundbreaking study on yoga and meditation with prisoners--tells us about the benefits and limitations of these techniques for improving our lives. As well as illuminating the potential, the authors argue that these practices may have unexpected consequences, and that peace and happiness may not always be the end result.\n \nOffering a compelling examination of research on transcendental meditation to recent brain-imaging studies on the effects of mindfulness and yoga, and with fascinating contributions from spiritual teachers and therapists, Farias and Wikholm weave together a unique story about the science and the delusions of personal change.\n\n\nAuthors: Miguel Farias and Catherine Wikholm\nPublisher: Watkins Publishing\nPublication: May 26, 2015\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d6cee16b607888b2968cb7798018886af1988c","amp;dn":"The+Buddha+Pill%3A+Can+Meditation+Change+You%3F+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d6cee16b607888b2968cb7798018886af1988c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,214,206,225,107,96,120,136,178,150,140,183,121,128,24,136,106,241,152,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
