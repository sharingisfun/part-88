Detective Lindsay Boxer is in labor--while two killers are on the loose.\n\nLindsay Boxer's beautiful baby is born! But after only a week at home with her new daughter, Lindsay is forced to return to work to face two of the biggest cases of her career.\n\nA rising star football player for the San Francisco 49ers is the prime suspect in a grisly murder. At the same time, Lindsay is confronted with the strangest story she's ever heard: An eccentric English professor has been having vivid nightmares about a violent murder and he's convinced is real. Lindsay doesn't believe him, but then a shooting is called in-and it fits the professor's description to the last detail.\n\nLindsay doesn't have much time to stop a terrifying future from unfolding. But all the crimes in the world seem like nothing when Lindsay is suddenly faced with the possibility of the most devastating loss of her life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2cba915dace396db9a6dae2c81c2976fb3e45f2","amp;dn":"James+Patterson12th+of+Never","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2cba915dace396db9a6dae2c81c2976fb3e45f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,203,169,21,218,206,57,109,185,166,218,226,200,28,41,118,251,62,69,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
