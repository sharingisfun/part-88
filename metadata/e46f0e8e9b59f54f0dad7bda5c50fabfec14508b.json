E. and Anthony Tarquin, P. E. (McGraw-Hill, 2012)\n\nISBN: 9780073376301\n\nEngineering Economy, 7th edition, presents a crisp, bold new design using color, highlighting and icons to focus on important concepts, terms, equations and decision guidelines. There are new features, new topics (such as ethics and staged decision making), and new online tools; yet no compromise on coverage, examples, or the well-accepted writing style of this popular text. The preface provides an overview of WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New and graphically depicts resources for Instructors and Students. Solved examples, problems and case studies target many of the current engineering challenges in areas such as energy, ethics, the environment, and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing economics. Approximately eighty percent of the end-of-chapter problems are revised or new for this edition.\nSome of the outstanding pedagogical characteristics of this new edition include its easy-to-read writing style, learning outcomes for each section, progressive examples used throughout a chapter, solved examples using manual and integrated spreadsheet solutions, updated case studies, Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam questions for each chapter, and numerous new end-of-chapter exercises.\n\nA significant new feature is the availability of brief, downloadable online presentations (podcasts) that incorporate voice-over, animated Power Point slides. These are available on the textÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website for students and instructors to utilize as support tools in or outside the classroom. Each module includes descriptive material and worked examples that supplement course material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46f0e8e9b59f54f0dad7bda5c50fabfec14508b","amp;dn":"Engineering+Economy+7th+ed+-+Leland+Blank%2C+Anthony+Tarquin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46f0e8e9b59f54f0dad7bda5c50fabfec14508b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,111,14,142,155,89,245,79,13,173,123,218,92,80,250,191,236,20,80,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
