Is that true?\n\nZorn: Well, in Japan, I have got a group of musicians that I have worked with a lot, that concentrate just on the hardcore stuff, say, that Naked City has been working on. We have like a repertoire of sixty songs now.\n\nWow. Does it have a name?\n\nZorn: It's called Torture Garden: Yoshida, the drummer from the Ruins; Eye is the vocalist, Ema Hori who is an incredible guitar player. And the bass player is also from the Ruins, this guy Kimoto. We just played at CB's last week. I brought them all over to New York to do some gigs.\n\nGreat. Is there going to be anything coming out on vinyl or CD of that band?\n\nZorn: For that particular band, nothing is planned yet. I'd like to do a twelve-inch with 5 songs or something like that. All the Torture Garden material has already been recorded by the band Naked City. That'll come out on Earache out of Great Britain and Shimmy Disc here in the States [ed. note: It came out in 1991].\n\nShimmy Disc is licensing the Earache record?\n\nZorn: Well, it's a complicated thing. Basically, this Naked City record (the first album on Nonesuch) came out, right. In the middle of it are about ten songs that are really short and hard. I said I wanted to do a record of 40 of those pieces, cause I was really interested in the compression and compactness of form that that music gets to. \n\n01. osaka bondage  2.38\n02. torture garden  1.23\n03. shangkuan ling-feng  1.26\n04. ujaku  1.18\n05. blunt instrument  2.00\n06. demon sanctuary  1.36\n07. no reason to believe  1.06\n08. shock corridor  1.44\n09. dead spot  1.14\n10. hellraiser  1.04\n11. numbskull  1.16\n12. thrash jazz assassin  1.20\n13. bonehead  1.50\n14. jazz snob eat shit  1.00\n15. the ways of pain  0.55\n16. piledriver  1.40\n17. shallow grave  1.07\n18. gob of spit/pistol whipping  1.50\n19. victims of torture  0.34\n20. victims of torture &quot;again&quot;  1.24\n21. igneous ejaculation  0.49\n22. speedball  1.18\n23. slan  1.01\n24. kaoru  1.13\n25. the blade  1.26\n26. facelifter  1.42\n27. whiplash false start  0.18\n28. whiplash  1.20\n29. sack of shit  1.01\n30. blood is thin  1.49\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677269f630acdad039e5981b8aef375b26e575c0","amp;dn":"Torture+Garden+-+New+York+%281990%29+9FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677269f630acdad039e5981b8aef375b26e575c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,114,105,246,48,172,218,208,57,229,152,27,138,239,55,91,38,229,117,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
