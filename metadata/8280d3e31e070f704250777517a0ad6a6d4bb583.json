She hates her job, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love the aristocratic man to whom she is engaged, and her relationship with her controlling mother is becoming increasingly strained. So Ellen leaves London, fleeing to the one place she knows her mother wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find her, her auntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cottage in Connemara. Cutting all her ties with chic London society, Ellen gives in to IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm and warmth, thinking her future may lie where so much of her past has been hidden. Her imagination is soon captured by the compelling ruins of a lighthouse where, five years earlier, a young mother died in a fire.\n\nThe ghost of the young wife, Caitlin, haunts the nearby castle, mourning the future she can never have there. Unable to move on, she watches her husband and children, hoping they might see her and feel her love once more. But she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anticipate her husband falling in love again. Can she prevent it? Or can she let go and find a way to freedom and happiness?\n\nThe ruggedly beautiful Connemara coastline with its tightknit community of unforgettable characters provides the backdrop for this poignant story of two women seeking the peace and love they desperately need. For each, the key will be found in the secrets of the past, illuminated by the lighthouse.\n\n\nProduct Details:\nFile size: epub 449 Kb, mobi 593 Kb\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster\nISBN: 978-1-47110-098-7 (ebook)\nLanguage: English\n\nEnjoy the read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8280d3e31e070f704250777517a0ad6a6d4bb583","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Lighthouse+ebook+by+Santa+Montefiore+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8280d3e31e070f704250777517a0ad6a6d4bb583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,128,211,227,30,7,15,112,66,80,119,117,23,160,173,106,109,75,181,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
