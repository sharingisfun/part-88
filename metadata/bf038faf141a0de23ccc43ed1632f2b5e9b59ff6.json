Through discussion, demonstrations and workshops, Pappano explores every aspect of the art of great singing.\n\nGods, demons, drunks, lechers, silly old codgers, double-dyed villains - life on stage for the bass is rarely dull. The baritone, meanwhile, is the most common male voice type, and yet the parts he sings - especially in the operas of Verdi - are anything but.\n\nPappano explores the lowest male voice types, and the roles they play - in comedy as well as tragedy. How do basses sing so low? What different qualities does a baritone bring to a Schubert song? He meets the Russian 'oktavists', who sing a whole octave lower than the standard bass. With the help of leading practitioners - Bryn Terfel, John Tomlinson, Ferruccio Furlanetto, Christian Gerhaher, Alessandro Corbelli and Willard White - Pappano uncovers the tricks of the trade. He examines in detail some key performances from the legendary basses and baritones of the past - Feodor Chaliapin, Tito Gobbi, Paul Robeson, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Boris Christoff , Nicolai Ghiaurov and Ezio Pinza","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf038faf141a0de23ccc43ed1632f2b5e9b59ff6","amp;dn":"Pappanos+Classical+Voices+s01e04+ENG+SUBS+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf038faf141a0de23ccc43ed1632f2b5e9b59ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,3,143,175,20,26,13,226,60,204,67,237,22,50,242,181,233,181,159,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
