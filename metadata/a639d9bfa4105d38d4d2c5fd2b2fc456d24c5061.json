The group's charter lineup was rounded out by bassist/vocalist Johan Liiva (Carnage, Furbowl) and drummer Daniel Erlandsson (Eucharist, session work for In Flames); they released their debut album, Black Earth, in 1996. For their second album, 1998's Stigmata, Armageddon bassist Martin Bengtsson took over those duties from vocalist Liiva, while Armageddon drummer Peter Wildoer sat in for Erlandsson. More personnel turnover ensued, as Mercyful Fate reunion bassist Sharlee D'Angelo (also formerly of Witchery and Dismember) joined up for 1999's Burning Bridges, which also featured the return of Erlandsson. Wages of Sin from 2001 found Johan Liiva departing and replaced by Angela Gossow. After touring extensively across Europe and Japan, the band returned to the studio and released Anthems of Rebellion in 2003. The EP Dead Eyes See No Future was released by the end of the year and featured a mix of cover versions and live tracks. The album Doomsday Machine landed in July of 2005 right as guitarist Christopher Amott announced he was leaving the band. Former Tiamat member Fredrik Ãƒâ€¦kesson replaced him.Death\nSubgenre: Melodic Death Metal / Gothenburg\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 172.24 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\nFile Name \tSize\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/01- The Immortal.mp3 \t8.47 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/02- Dead Inside.mp3 \t9.59 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/03- Pilgrim.mp3 \t10.37 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/04- Silverwing.mp3 \t9.42 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/05- Demonic Science.mp3 \t12.29 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/06- Seed Of Hate.mp3 \t9.46 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/07- Angelclaw.mp3 \t9.32 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/08- Burning Bridges.mp3 \t12.62 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/09- Fields Of Desolation (1999 Version).mp3 \t13.82 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/10- Star Breaker (Judas Priest Cover).mp3 \t7.78 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/11- Aces High (Iron Maiden Cover).mp3 \t10.09 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/12- Scream Of Anger (Europe Cover).mp3 \t8.66 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/13- The Immortal (Live In Japan '99).mp3 \t8.98 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/14- Dead Inside (Live In Japan '99).mp3 \t10.49 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/15- Pilgrim (Live In Japan '99).mp3 \t10.44 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/16- Silverwing (Live In Japan '99).mp3 \t9.78 MB\n2009 Burning Bridges (Deluxe Edition)/17- Angelclaw (Live In Japan '99).mp3 \t10.66 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a639d9bfa4105d38d4d2c5fd2b2fc456d24c5061","amp;dn":"Arch+Enemy+-+Burning+Bridges+%28Deluxe+Edition+Re-Release%29+2009+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a639d9bfa4105d38d4d2c5fd2b2fc456d24c5061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,57,217,191,164,16,93,56,212,210,197,253,43,47,196,86,210,76,80,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
