America is a Christian country. Compared to other countries, religion thrives. 90% of Americans believe in God. 40% say they go to church every week. In France and Germany, fewer than 10% go. In Denmark, 3%.\n\nINDIANA LAW: Opponents of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act say it discriminates against gays. Others say it's a matter of religious freedom. I say it should be about individual freedom. All debate.\n\nSEPARATION OF CHURCH &amp; STATE: Most Americans believe in separation of church and state. But in some towns, the 10 commandments are posted conspicuously in front of courthouses. &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is written all over our currency.\n\nIs this wrong? It turns out that &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution. My guests debate.\n\nDESECRATING THE SACRED: In Texas, the Lipan Apache Indian tribe has celebrated its religion for thousands of years by conducting a ceremony that includes wearing eagle feathers.\n\nEagles are no longer endangered, and anyway, the tribe doesn't use feathers from live birds. Nevertheless, the Fish and Wildlife service raided the tribe and confiscated feathers because the tribe didn't have a permit for feathers. &quot;For the government to take those feathers away is like ripping the heart out of their religion&quot; says Kristina Arriaga of the Becket Fund.\n\nBIRTH CONTROL: Our current big-government president says he believes in freedom of religion. But that didn't stop his functionaries from forcing Christian groups that believe birth control is murder to pay for birth control pills and morning-after pills for their employees.\n\nBLUE LAWS: Depending on what state you're in, you may not be allowed to buy this bottle on Sunday...\n\nThat's because &quot;blue laws&quot; say Sunday should be a day of worship. But not all religions worship on Sunday. Blue laws blur the appropriate relationship between church and state.\n\nFREE-MARKET FAITH: The Pilgrims and the Puritans did not come to America for religious freedom for all of us (as many people think). They enforced their own religious tyranny. But once the federal government limited their power to tax for religion, America's religious market grew diverse. That created competition and innovation and that's a reason religion has thrived in America.\n\nMY TAKE: When it comes to religion, I want to believe. I see the sense of peace and purpose that many religious people have. So I've tried to become religious. I even tried Buddhism and Hinduism in my hippie days!\n\nBut nothing stuck. What I do know is that if people are free to choose how and when to worship, or not to, we are all freer, and better off.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.04.17.Church.and.State.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 2s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 190 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 2s\nBit rate                                 : 1 052 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.155\nStream size                              : 309 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1052 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 2s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4aa4b8a773697be8a3eda6eda1f43ab5a4038b","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.04.17.Church.and.State.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4aa4b8a773697be8a3eda6eda1f43ab5a4038b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,74,164,184,167,115,105,123,232,163,237,166,237,161,244,58,181,164,3,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
