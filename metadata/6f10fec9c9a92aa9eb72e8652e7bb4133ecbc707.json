Dr Caldwell calls her 'our little genius'.\n\nEvery morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When they come for her, Sergeant keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don't like her. She jokes that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.\n\nMelanie loves school. She loves learning about spelling and sums and the world outside the classroom and the children's cells. She tells her favourite teacher all the things she'll do when she grows up.\n\nMelanie doesn't know why this makes Miss Justineau look sad.\n\nRead by Finty Williams\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f10fec9c9a92aa9eb72e8652e7bb4133ecbc707","amp;dn":"M.R.+Carey+-+The+Girl+with+All+the+Gifts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f10fec9c9a92aa9eb72e8652e7bb4133ecbc707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,16,254,201,201,169,42,169,235,114,232,101,46,123,180,19,62,203,199,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
