Meanwhile, the Count Dracula is in London searching for a new home and coincidentally, or not, comes across young Elizabeth at the train station after she's run away from home and her father's overbearing ways. Dracula, though, proceeds to kidnap her and take Elizabeth to his castle where he waits for her father's arrival to settle an ancient dispute. Meanwhile, Bram' friend Malcolm sets out to inform Bram of Elizabeth' kidnapping but he soon falls to Dracula's evil ways. And, upon finding his best friend dead Bram sets out across Europe to rescue his true love. \n\naka Bram Stoker's Dracula's Guest\nRelease Date: August 2008 (video premiere)\nDirector: Michael Feifer\nWriter: Michael Feifer\nStars: Amy Lyndon, Wes Ramsey, Andrew Bryniarski\nGenre: Adventure, Horror, Thriller\nProduction Co:  North American Entertainment, Barnholtz Entertainment\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRuntime: 82 min\nColor: Color\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35be67e0c3fd1c60c7ff33402d384f41cef983cd","amp;dn":"Dracula%27s+Guest+2008+DVDRiP.XViD-HoRRoRFReaKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35be67e0c3fd1c60c7ff33402d384f41cef983cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,190,103,224,195,253,28,96,199,255,51,64,45,56,79,65,206,249,131,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
