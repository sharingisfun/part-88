Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nHappy Monday. It's a new week of politics and a new monologue. Scott Walker enters the massive GOP presidential race. Can he pull attention away from the circus that is Donald Trump?\n\nTonight's panel consists of JEDIDIAH BILA, ANDY LEVY, and JANICE DEAN. They continue to talk about Scott Walker. His chances, his social conservatism, and his union busting ways. Marine Vet and Democrat Jim Webb is throwing his hat into the presidential ring. He thinks his fellow Democrats are too liberal.\n\nOur pretty party panel returns to talk about 2016 candidates being done with Donald Trump. Christie hates 'em, Jeb is done with 'em. Could this be why he's polling at second place? Stresiand effect as applied to presidential politics. \n\nHillary has laid out her economic plan. She's big on things being &quot;fair&quot;. JOHNATHAN HOENIG is here via satellite to discuss. Some pretty hyperbolic language used by our guest, but then again he is billed as the &quot;Capitalist Pig Hedge Fund Founder&quot;.\n\nTOPICAL STORM:\nDavid Letterman does a Donald Trump top 10 list.\nDanica Patrick spares no insults after being rear ended by Dale Earnhardt Jr.\nTaylor Swift reserves the right to injure photographers.\nGuy drops shovel, makes Nirvana song.\nBrian Cranston drops the mic at Comic-con.\n\nTODAY IS NATIONAL FRENCH FRY DAY! It's our first annual french fry test here on Kennedy. She does a blind taste test. Nails each one, gets messed up hair. Smart Cities are on the way. How long is it before privacy becomes a fuzzy memory?\n\nMATT BESSER of the Upright Citizens Brigade is here via satellite to talk about the California drought, celebrities with palatial green estates surrounded by deserts, his podcast &quot;Improv for Humans&quot;, and snitching on his neighbors.\n\nJANICE DEAN returns sans the party panel to talk about her kids book &quot;Freddy the Frogcaster&quot;.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.07.13.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 10s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 159 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 10s\nBit rate                                 : 1 020 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.155\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1020 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 10s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ca44b7abd41fd08f4c9dc8709bc843e7d7a0de2","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.07.13.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ca44b7abd41fd08f4c9dc8709bc843e7d7a0de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,164,75,122,189,65,253,8,244,201,220,135,9,188,132,62,125,122,13,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
