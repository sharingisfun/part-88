The journal's name derives from its devotion to discussing the ethnic, racial and cultural heritage that forms the foundation of Western Civilization as well as the contemporary political, social and demographic trends that affect this tradition. It has been described as a white nationalist journal that seeks to direct American conservatism in the direction of an Anglo-Saxon cultural and racial ideology.\n\nThe journal is published by the Charles Martel Society named in honor of Charles Martel, who halted a Muslim invasion of Europe at the Battle of Tours in 732. They explicitly reject neoconservatism and call for a &quot;third school&quot; to emerge from paleoconservatism in the from of an ideology of White European identity politics, and holds that the American political order of freedom and liberty is under ethnic and ideological threat. Its foreign policy positions, broadly, are anti-immigration with the exception of those from other industrialized Western nations, and isolationism, including the rejection of influence from Israel and Mexico on U.S. politics. \n\nThe Occidental Quarterly - Vol. 14, No. 4 - Winter, 2014-2015 Table of Contents:\n\nARTICLE\n\nOswald Spengler and the Faustian Soul of the West\nRicardo Duchesne\n\nThe Tragic Legacy of World War I\nHereward T.
