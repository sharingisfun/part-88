They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot; are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called &quot;God's Eye,&quot; that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government.\n\nTRAILER:\n\n\n\nXx\nXXXx\nXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxXXXXXXXXx\nXXXXXXXXX=iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE          EEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE          XX    XX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE           XX  XX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE            XXXX  tat!C\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEEEEEEEEE      XXX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEEEEEEE       XX XX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE           XX   XX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE          XX     XX\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEE           EEEEE\nXXXXXXXXX-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nIf you are a Filipino, well fellow we can prove to the world that we can make difference.
