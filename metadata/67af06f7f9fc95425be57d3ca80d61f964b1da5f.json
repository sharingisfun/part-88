rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Story_%28film_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPolice Story 2 was made to be the sequel to Police Story 1. Jackie directs this (and PS 1) and keeps the same type of serious tone but adds in more humor. The story is not as tight or gripping as the first but most Jackie fans will enjoy this.\n\n It starts out with the bad guy who Jackie sends to jail at the end of PS 1 (famous Shaw Brothers director Yuen Chor) out for revenge now that he is out of jail. He hires a guy to constantly harass Jackie and get into fights with him.\n It gets more complex than that and there is a real plot but the movie drags along too much before the fantastic ending sequence finally comes.\n\nIt was cool to see old school star John Cheung ('Snake in the Monkey's Shadow' and 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story') in a major role as one of the bad guys. Ben Lam ('Legend of the Wolf') also has a major part. Even one of Jackie's very best stuntmen Benny Lai is given a big role as the deaf mute. Benny Lai is a little guy but his kicking abilities are spectacular.\n I think the movie could have been a lot better but Maggie Cheung is even more enjoyable than she was in part 1 and it is a very fun film. Michael Chow and Lau Ching Wan also have cameos as cops. Both being fairly new to the movie scene at this time.\n And of course it is always great to see Bill Tung playing Uncle Bill and Mars as one of Jackie's cop buddies. You have to love Uncle Bill.\n\nAkin to Jackie Chan's other movies, expect the best of the best stuntwork from Jackie and his team. Very inventive as always. I can't even imagine how much it would hurt trying to lay down every night during the shooting of this. In PS 1, Jackie came up with his own type of action choreography. He went away from long matches where each opponent throws hundreds of punches and kicks with 1 person barely coming out alive at the end.\n Jackie tried to give the fights more realism since it is a modern day film. Combine the amazing stuntwork with the real type of fighting and it is just a pure joy to watch.\n I actually like Jackie's old school kung fu movies better, but the new style of action that he developed has been featured in his movies ever since PS 1 and he hasn't done too bad for himself.\n There is nothing like watching Jackie in action, and his skills are on full display in this classic.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/w8lKxOg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/w8lKxOg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
