Lured by the promise of America, Eilis departs Ireland and the comfort of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home for the shores of New York City. The initial shackles of homesickness quickly diminish as a fresh romance sweeps Eilis into the intoxicating charm of love. But soon, her new vivacity is disrupted by her past, and she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.\n\nDirector: John Crowley\n\nWriters: Nick Hornby\n\nActors: Saoirse Ronan, Domhnall Gleeson, Emory Cohen, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters\n\nGenre: Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e01e73be35b5143de9353b4870a2c5a44150d32","amp;dn":"Brooklyn.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e01e73be35b5143de9353b4870a2c5a44150d32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,1,231,59,227,91,81,67,222,147,83,180,135,10,44,90,68,21,13,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
