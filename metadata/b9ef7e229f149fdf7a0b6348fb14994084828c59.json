Don't worry about it. It's nothing.\n\nQ&amp;A:\n\nI already bought the rig, do I get this version free?\n\nI was thinking long and hard and everyone was saying for me to just stop free updates. Things have changed. Piracy has become more of a problem so I'm just stopping it. I spend too much time and effort for it to go to waste so I'm sorry it's not free. :(\n\nHow much does the rig cost?\n\n$30\n\nWhy is it so expensive!?\n\nI spent a lot of time making all these features. If you want to buy it tell your parent you will not eat food for a week and by the end of a week you will have saved $30. Congratulations :D seriously try it though.\n\nHow long did it take to make the rig?\n\n2- 3 months\n\nIs it laggy?\n\nI actually hardly used any range mappers. I only used math nodes, compares and conditions to make the rig. This reduces calculations and lag drastically. The new method of copying and pasting keyframes also is a huge plus when working with big scenes.\n\nI have a question but you're not responding. Where can I contact you?\n\nEmail me at\n\n----------------------------------------Ã‚Â­--------\n\nInfo:\n\nTwitter:\nAnimation Channel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ef7e229f149fdf7a0b6348fb14994084828c59","amp;dn":"Anishwij+Rig+v8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9ef7e229f149fdf7a0b6348fb14994084828c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,239,126,34,159,20,159,223,122,11,99,72,251,20,153,64,132,130,140,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
