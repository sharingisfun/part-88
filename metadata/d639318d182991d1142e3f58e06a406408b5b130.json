Ron Hubbard\nChannel 4\nWednesday 19th November 1997\n21:00\n\nA biography of Hubbard's life and the Scientology cult.\n\nLafayette Ronald Hubbard (13 March 1911 - 24 January 1986), better known as L. Ron Hubbard, was an American science fiction writer and founder of Scientology and Dianetics.\n\nA controversial public figure, many details of his life are subjects of contention. The Church of Scientology has produced numerous official biographies which present Hubbard's character and his multi-faceted accomplishments in an exalted light. Biographies of Hubbard by independent journalists and accounts by former scientologists paint a much darker picture of Hubbard and in many cases contradict the material presented by the Church.\n\n\nThis is similar to the 325 MB version that is around, but with improved audio.\nThanks to the original cappers.\n\n\n--- Video ---\nFormat:           MPEG-4\nEncoder:          DivX 5.x/6.x\nBitrate:          764kb/s\nResolution:       640x480\nPacked bitstream: No\nQpel:             No\nGMC:              No\nInterlaced:       No\n\n--- Audio ---\nFormat:           MP3\nEncoder:          FhG\nBitrate:          CBR 160kb/s\nSample Rate:      32000Hz\n\n--- Source ---\nVHS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d639318d182991d1142e3f58e06a406408b5b130","amp;dn":"Secret+Lives+-+L.+Ron+Hubbard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d639318d182991d1142e3f58e06a406408b5b130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,57,49,141,24,41,145,209,20,46,63,88,224,106,64,100,8,181,177,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
