The first video shows Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Senior Director of Medical Services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, describing how Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted unborn children and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts. In this video, Mary Gatter, the Medical director at Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley in Calfiornia, discusses selling aborted baby body parts with undercover investigators posing as officials with a biotech company that acts as a middleman to sell aborted baby body parts to universities and other places that conduct such research. Gatter is a senior official within Planned Parenthood and is President of the Medical DirectorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Council, the central committee of all Planned Parenthood affiliate medical directors. Gatter discusses the pricing of aborted baby body parts Ã¢â‚¬â€ telling the biotech company officials that the prices for such things as a babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liver, head or heart are negotiable. She also tells the officials\nthat she could talk with the Planned Parenthood abortion practitioners to potentially alter the abortion procedure to kill the baby in a way that would best preserve those body parts after the unborn child is killed in the abortion. \n\n(FULL UNEDITED VIDEO AT BOTTOM OF THIS POST) The video shows Gatter haggling over payments for intact fetal specimens and offering to use a Ã¢â‚¬Å“less crunchy techniqueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to get more intact body parts. Actors posing as buyers ask Gatter, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What would you expect for intact [fetal] tissue? Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you start by telling me what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to paying!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gatter replies. SIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately Gatter continues: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know, in negotiations whoever throws out the figure first is at a loss, right?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to lowball,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ before suggesting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“$75 a specimen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gatter twice recites Planned Parenthood messaging on fetal tissue collection, Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not in it for the money,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The money is not the important thing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but she immediately qualifies each statement with, respectively, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But what were you thinking of?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But it has to be big enough that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worthwhile for me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gatter also admits that in prior fetal tissue deals, Planned Parenthood received payment in spite of incurring no cost: Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was logistically very easy for us, we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to do anything. \n\nSo there was compensation for this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She accepts a higher price of $100 per specimen understanding that it will be only for high-quality fetal organs: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now, this is for tissue that you actually take, not just tissue that someone volunteers and you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anything, right?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ By the lunchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, Gatter suggests $100 per specimen is not enough and concludes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let me just figure out what others are getting, and if this is in the ballpark, then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine, if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still low, then we can bump it up. I want a Lamborghini.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gatter also suggests modifying the abortion procedure to get more intact fetuses: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t object to asking Ian, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our surgeon who does the cases, to use an IPAS [manual vacuum aspirator] at that gestational age in order to increase the odds that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to get an intact specimen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gatter seems aware this violates rules governing tissue collection, but disregards them: Ã¢â‚¬Å“To me, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of a specious little argument.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Federal law requires that no alteration in the timing or method of abortion be done for the purposes of fetal tissue collection (42 U.S.C. 289g-1). The video, like last weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s featuring Dr. Nucatola, was produced by The Center for Medical Progress and is part of CMPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly 3-year-long investigative journalism study, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Human Capital.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ CMPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Project Lead David Daleiden notes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Planned ParenthoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top leadership admits they harvest aborted baby parts and receive payments for this. \n\nPlanned ParenthoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only denial is that they make money off of baby parts, but that is a desperate lie that becomes more and more untenable as CMP reveals Planned ParenthoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business operations and statements that prove otherwise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue, who was also involved in putting the investigative exposeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ video together told LifeNews that the refutes Cecile RichardsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ claim that there is no profit for Planned Parenthood and raises further questions about the unethical altering of procedures to one Ã¢â‚¬Å“less crunchy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The statements in the Gatter video prove that Cecile Richards flat-out lied when she said that Planned Parenthood does not profit in any way from the sale of aborted baby parts. It takes a lot of baby livers to buy a Lamborghini,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And now it also appears that Planned Parenthood is also lying to women, altering their procedures in order to get body parts that can be sold for profit. These represent serious legal and ethical breeches for which Planned Parenthood must be held accountable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In the first video, as LifeNews reported, new undercover footage shows Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Senior Director of Medical Services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, describing how Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted unborn children and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts. Nucatola is an Obama administration adviser.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lifenews.com/2015/07/14/shock-video-catches-planned-parenthoods-top-doctor-selling-body-parts-of-aborted-babies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lifenews.com/2015/07/14/shock-video-catches-planned-parenthoods-top-doctor-selling-body-parts-of-aborted-babies/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d68a397b9eb123ff398f05af9929122912b1c6","amp;dn":"Planned+Parenthood+Leaked+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d68a397b9eb123ff398f05af9929122912b1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,214,138,57,123,158,177,35,255,57,143,5,175,153,41,18,41,18,177,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
