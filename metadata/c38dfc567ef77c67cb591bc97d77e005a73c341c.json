Otherwise, you should go ahead by following the alphabetical order.\n\nThe Bytes seasons were put in separate season folders because these are considered as &quot;stories from an alternate universe&quot; and originally organizes into two separate seasons on their own.\nThese folder names start with Season 7 because these videos were released along with the &quot;real&quot; Season 7 episodes:\nBS1 happened between 7.1 and 7.6, BS2 between 7.6 and 7.7\n\n\nThe show is officially and technically ended with 7.25\n\n\nI almost ruined this show for myself when I ended up watching random episodes on youtube (and thus think it doesn't really make any sense) before I stopped to find Jon's blog and figure out the correct order of the videos. After that, I felt I should keep, and even distribute this pack to help the newcomers and for those who want a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; kind of pack. \nThe latter is one reason why I didn't merge the episodes into single season videos (by cutting the individial intros and credits, etc). The other one is the quality (it's shitty as it is, it really doesn't need another re-encoding).\n\n\nBelow, you can see the list of the episodes as they were listed on Jon's official blog as of 2013.14.10:\n(Short #5 is missing from this list for some reason.
