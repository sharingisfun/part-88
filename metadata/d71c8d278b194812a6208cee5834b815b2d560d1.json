You see, his father also disappeared in the same area when he was a child, and he caught glimpses of the beast that did it, even as the investigators never found anything nor a body. It ate away at him all this time, until it happened again, and now he grabs a gun and gets a helicopter pilot named Mark to fly him to the area so he can go hunting. Of course, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return which worries his sexy as hell sister Nina, who knows Brian has been more unstable since he returned from his tour. She calls in his whole cadre of friends, including herÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complicatedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ relationship status partner, Rick. The rest of the group includes Stacey and John Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a married couple that returned all their presents for cash Stacey eager to reenlist while John wants to start a family, and Erlander Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who seems like a sixth wheel until you realize he has PTSD. They agree to go look for Brian, which is complicated by the approaching megastorm (and the ski patrol rescue workers losing two team members due to abominable snowman chomping.) Mark is who they get to take them up, as he knows where he dropped off Brian.\n\nAfter a risky canyon shortcut by chopper, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ski ski ski ski, snowboard snowboard snowboard, as the group looks for Brian. Rick takes charge because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a can-do type of guy. Until John gets avalanched! And he had the satellite phoneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not dead yet but too injured to move, the phone is missing, and their worry of how to carry him down in the storm is solved when the Abominable Snowman jumps in and grabs John and runs off.\n\nThe group finds Brian in an abandoned ski lodge. He freaks out when he finds out people died looking for him. Then the monster attacks and injures Erlander, and they sort of escape except another Abominable Snowman is outside. So the title was a lie, there is more than one! The new plan is to continue barricading themselves in smaller and smaller rooms while Erlander gets more nuts, until he sacrifices himself to buy them some time.\n\nThe creatures leave, so the heroes will go all Home Alone and set traps in the house for the monsters. Complete with montage. This could have been awesome, with a long sequence of wacky traps doing hilarious things to monsters, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen. The Abominable Snowmen just stroll in, one immediately falls into the cellar and the other kills Stacey. Then the heroes lock the door and throw in a grenade by some gas tanks and kaboom! Explosion and monster death.\n\nHey, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still time on the clock, one of them canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be dead, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not! They ski ski ski, but the Abominable Snowman can run on snow very very fast. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tarstarkas.net/2013/05/abominable-snowman/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tarstarkas.net/2013/05/abominable-snowman/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869362/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869362/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71c8d278b194812a6208cee5834b815b2d560d1","amp;dn":"abominable+snowman+deadly+descent+2013+720x404.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71c8d278b194812a6208cee5834b815b2d560d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,28,141,39,139,25,72,18,166,32,140,238,88,52,184,21,178,213,96,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
