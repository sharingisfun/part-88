Ashuton Karrucci continues his adventures in life, and so do many other people that befriend the Dragons of Earth. They came in the Pre-Cambrian Epoch and they have been a big part of life. Space Dragons, something untried before, are attempted once again in this special. Follow the adventures of Unknown Girl, a woman looking for her mother in a post-Dragon War world, and Ashuton Karrucci, the god of dragons going about his daily life with the Dragons of Italy. Included in this collection is the Definitive Guide to Space Dragons. Learn about their culture, songs, cities, ships, weapons, breeds, leaders and Gods. Learn their languages and the history of their empire. As an added treat are extra stories that kill the stereotypical tropes associated with Dragons. From Dragons on Mars to cybernetic Dragons, this is a book you won't want to miss!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8bfcd6006697ae986c6490bfcd64f9054311748","amp;dn":"Dragons+and+Cicadas+-+Nipaporn+Baldwin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8bfcd6006697ae986c6490bfcd64f9054311748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,191,205,96,6,105,122,233,134,198,73,11,252,214,79,144,84,49,23,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
