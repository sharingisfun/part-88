Both 32 and 64 bit versions included. The ADVANCED release contains a full suite of codecs and the Standard Codecs only contains the LAV filters and xy-VSFilter for subtitles. \n\nThe installer will automatically remove most other popular codec releases from your computer before installing this concise yet comprehensive package. \n\nCodecs have been a problem for most users at one time or another. This is because there has never been an 'out of the box' working solution that the average computer user could install and just have everything work properly from the beginning. There are several decent codec package solutions out there, but none of them did everything I wanted. I was always in need of a tweak, adjustment, or even a re-installation just to get the codecs I needed/wanted and most of the time, the file still didn't play properly. This frustration was the basis for me to begin making a codecpack that works with ALL players. \n\nThe installer will automatically remove most other popular codec releases from your computer before installing this concise yet comprehensive windows media center setup package. \n\n\n \n\n\n* Just Run to use... \n\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a46ce973e4094cf21b865752c7f2bc57ced80d","amp;dn":"ADVANCED+Codecs+for+Windows+10+%2F+8.1+%2F+7+5.35","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a46ce973e4094cf21b865752c7f2bc57ced80d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,164,108,233,115,228,9,76,242,27,134,87,82,199,242,188,87,206,216,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
