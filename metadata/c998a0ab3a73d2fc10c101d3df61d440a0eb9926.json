The first edition has been highly successful in engineering schools where introductory programming is taught using MATLAB rather than a traditional programming language. Although C, C++, and Java suit the needs of computer science students well, most engineering students will not be programmers by trade. Engineering students use computer tools to perform complex tasks such as scientific calculations, data analysis, simulations, and visualization: all skills students will use again in upper level classes. MATLAB provides several built in toolkits to help students accomplish these tasks, as well as an integrated devlopment environment. This book is distinctly unique from other MATLAB books in two ways. First, it is an introduction to MATLAB as a technical programming language rather than an introduction to the MATLAB environment. The author includes numerous pedagogical tools such as special boxes that highlight good programming practices, boxes that detail common pitfalls in MATLAB programming, and numerous programming exercises and examples. The book also makes wide use of MATLAB's predefined functions that provide tested solutions and time saved in writing subroutines or functions. Second, the book teaches students how to write clean, efficient, and documented programs using sound problem solving techniques. Top-down programming methodology is introduced to the students in Ch. 3 and is used consistently thoughout the rest of the book. This encourages students to think about the proper design of a program before beginning to code","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c998a0ab3a73d2fc10c101d3df61d440a0eb9926","amp;dn":"MATLAB+Programming+for+Engineers+2nd+ed+-+Stephen+J.+Chapman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c998a0ab3a73d2fc10c101d3df61d440a0eb9926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,152,160,171,58,115,210,252,16,193,1,211,223,97,212,64,160,235,153,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
