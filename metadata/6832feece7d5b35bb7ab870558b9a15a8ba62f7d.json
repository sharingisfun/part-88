In this revealing new series we explore the surprisingly human ways that animal mums (and dads) instinctively raise their young. In this episode, A gorilla has difficulties in labour, and a rare white rhino finds protecting her baby a challenge.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/08/27/c3f1704cbf351cc6a301bc2b9cd810ad.jpg[/img]\n\nIn episode 1, we begin in the precious moments straight after mum gives birth. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll witness her first magical bond with baby and learn about the importance of the senses as she welcomes her new born. We discover tricks for feeding her babies, and the incredible ways animal mums protect their young. We also meet some amazing animals who have come through against the odds to prove just what wonderful mums they are. \n \nWhen a lamb is born, mum must get to work straight away. Senses such as hearing, smell and touch are vital for getting baby on her feet as soon as possible. With reassuring bleats, mum starts to clean her little one from head to toe, licking and nuzzling getting the blood flowing and stimulating her muscles. For many herd animals, being up and running as quickly as possible is a matter of life or death. We meet a new-born foal who will be galloping with the herd before the sun goes down.\n \nAt San Diego Zoo Safari Park, gorilla mum-to-be Imani experienced difficulties when giving birth and was rushed for an emergency C-section. It was hoped she would be united with her baby as soon as she came round, but new-born Joanne had pneumonia and had to be treated before being returned to her mum. With every day that passed Park staff became increasingly concerned that Imani wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognise her offspring. Eventually, 13 days later, they were able to attempt a reintroduction; to everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge relief and joy Imani took Joanne up into her arms. The pair have been inseparable since.  \n \nDolly the Gloucester old spot pig has her work cut out feeding her 8 hungry piglets. Adam Henson conducts an experiment to see if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true that piglets return to the same teat at every feed.\n \nAfter it became clear to staff at Living Coasts Aquarium that South American fur seal Grace was unable to nurse her new born Klara, they had to step in to ensure her survival. Keeper Lee became KlaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrogate mother feeding her night and day, teaching her to swim and even mimicking her noises and speaking Ã¢â‚¬ËœsealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n \nHighland cows hide their new born calves while they feed. This is an instinct that will have developed as a way of protecting their young from predators. Today, the predators have gone but the instinct survives and it can be a bit of a headache for famer Keith Jackson and his daughter Jess as they try to keep an eye on his herd.\n \nThree years ago endangered white rhino Thandi survived a horrific poaching attempt, which left her with a mutilated face and no horn. Vet Will Fowlds and volunteer Angie Goody have been treating this remarkable rhino since. Against all odds, in January this year, Thandi had a calf, named Thembi (meaning Hope). But having lost her only means of protecting herself and her baby, times will always be hard for this pair","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6832feece7d5b35bb7ab870558b9a15a8ba62f7d","amp;dn":"Animal.Mums.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6832feece7d5b35bb7ab870558b9a15a8ba62f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,50,254,236,231,213,179,91,183,171,135,5,88,185,161,90,139,166,47,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
