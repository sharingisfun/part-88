The relationship of humans to the cosmos is examined through the exploration of phenomenology, metaphysics and the arts. The authors of this volume write on a variety of topics which all seek to open the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes to the relationship of humans and our perception of our place in the cosmos. This volume offers a framework in which to present a rich panorama; a variety of perspectives illustrating how the perception of the interplay between human beings and the celestial realm advances in common experience and worldviews. This attempt to uncover our cosmic position is a great and worthwhile intellectual challenge. Philosophy as well as literature and the arts are nourished by this human quest for knowledge and understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd33f2395a07b024a9ff0027f5a0ab7d6e4f8bad","amp;dn":"From+Sky+and+Earth+to+Metaphysics+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd33f2395a07b024a9ff0027f5a0ab7d6e4f8bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,51,242,57,90,7,176,36,169,255,0,39,245,160,171,125,110,79,139,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
