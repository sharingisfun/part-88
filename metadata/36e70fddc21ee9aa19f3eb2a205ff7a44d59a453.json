This led to him being chosen as the presenter of 'The Tube', the seminal Friday night music programme, now recognized as the blueprint for a new style of music show.&quot;\n\nAnyway, this is a fantastic 54 minutes delve into history, great music and, of course, lots of fun.\n\nVideo Details:\n--------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : The Police In Montserrat (Jools Holland XviD.AC3).avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 826 MiB\nDuration                                 : 53mn 47s\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 146 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Custom\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 53mn 47s\nBit rate                                 : 1 945 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 704 pixels\nHeight                                   : 536 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.206\nStream size                              : 748 MiB (91%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 53mn 47s\nSource duration                          : 53mn 47s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 73.9 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nI haven't made any attempt to improve on the quality of this video.
