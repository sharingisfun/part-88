It has so far only aired on pay TV (which I don't waste my money on), so few people are likely to ever see it. It's a miracle they even released this DVD. There is a season two, but don't expect that DVD to ever be released.\n\n----------\n\nSource: PAL R4 DVD\nVideo: 1024x576, 25fps, h.264\nAudio: AC3* 224Kbps\nContainer: MP4\n\nEach episode is around 25-26 minutes in length (including credits and titles).\n\nThe files are a bit large, I know. I tried encoding at a lower bit rate (and resolution), but was unsatisfied with result.\n\n*Since the bit rate of the audio was already quite low, I decided to leave it untouched. Some media players will not decode AC3 if it is in an MP4 container. If that happens, use VLC or run it through a transcoder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2ea72fc563e16c0f9e0f0428d7d9f3e69c4b16","amp;dn":"Tony+Robinson%27s+Time+Walks+season+one","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd2ea72fc563e16c0f9e0f0428d7d9f3e69c4b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,46,167,47,197,99,225,108,15,158,15,4,40,215,217,243,230,156,75,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
