Field tested by numerous operating plants, the book describes technical solutions to reduce energy consumption leading to significant returns on capital and includes an 8-point Guidelines for Success. The book provides managers, chemical and mechanical engineers, and plant operators with methods and tools for continuous energy and process improvements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c95ec34e389ed9e20f4fbe91f80ddd115d0574","amp;dn":"Energy+and+Process+Optimization+for+the+Process+Industries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c95ec34e389ed9e20f4fbe91f80ddd115d0574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,201,94,195,78,56,158,217,226,15,79,190,145,248,13,221,17,93,5,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
