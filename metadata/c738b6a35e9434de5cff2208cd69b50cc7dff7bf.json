Cook credited Steve Jobs for putting these values deep into Apple a long time ago and added that they will be the values of Apple for a long time to come.\n\nFinally, Cook talked about how the partnership between Apple and U2 came about, remarking that the album is Ã¢â‚¬Å“killerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that they were Ã¢â‚¬Å“thrilledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with it. Cook said that Apple wanted to give something back its customers, which led to giving the album away for free.\n\nDuring part one of the interview, Cook talked about ideas behind the Apple Watch, AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partnership with IBM, purchasing Beats, and how he and Steve Jobs discussed him becoming CEO.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c738b6a35e9434de5cff2208cd69b50cc7dff7bf","amp;dn":"Tim+Cook+with+Charlie+Rose+interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c738b6a35e9434de5cff2208cd69b50cc7dff7bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,56,182,163,94,148,52,222,92,255,34,8,205,105,181,12,199,223,247,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
