This music is full of colour and luminosity ; a compelling mix of dreamy orchestral music that generates a warm and harmonious mood, together with a fresh, poetic, lyrical quality that is remarkably expressive and pleasurable. Philip Chapman's music always celebrates our potential for feeling of joy and a relaxed serenity, and one certainly emerges from this music with a sense of optimism and a calm delight.\n\n1 The Rainbow Dawn 20:23\n2 Planetary Renaissance 19:27\n\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nSecure rip\n\nAudio CD\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLabel: New World Music\nASIN: B00006ILVQ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efadc838d3335f3be845a5058f52223f24f9e53a","amp;dn":"Philip+Chapman+-+The+Golden+Age+CDRip+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efadc838d3335f3be845a5058f52223f24f9e53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,173,200,56,211,51,95,59,232,69,165,5,143,82,34,63,36,249,229,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
