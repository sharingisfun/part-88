The dead walk the earth and feed on the flesh of the living. The birth of a terrifying new world is at hand. ZombieWorld, the comic-book series that set the standard for comics of the undead is back in a massive trade paperback. Bob Fingerman and Tommy Lee Edwards take us into the darkened subway tunnels of New York, where the rats aren't the only things that bite, in the critically-acclaimed Winter's Dregs. Kelley Jones spins his own twisted tale of love and the undead in Eat Your Heart Out. A family's Christmas gathering has a few unexpected arrivals in Gordon Rennie and Gary Erskine's Home For the Holidays. And the apocalypse proves to be more horrifying than anyone ever imagined in Pat Mills and J. Deadstock's Tree of Death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aee274b0090826e9d2a86e4925f987e733a39a8","amp;dn":"ZombieWorld_-_Winter%27s_Dregs_and_Other_Stories_%282005%29_%28digital%29_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aee274b0090826e9d2a86e4925f987e733a39a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,238,39,75,0,144,130,110,157,42,134,228,146,95,152,126,115,58,57,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
