By far the world's largest country, it extends across the whole of northern Asia and the eastern third of Europe, spanning eleven time zones. &quot;The Britannica Guide to Russia&quot; offers a panoramic view of Russia, telling the history of the nation since 1917 as well as the story of its culture, religion, arts, and literature in the twentieth century and beyond. Particular focus is made on the contemporary nation since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
