Introduced from 2002 onwards, they share design characteristics with the successful Eurosprinter range of electric locomotives, also built by Siemens.\n\nThe locomotive is designed to be made of as few parts as possible, and is of modular construction, with separate components (engine, electronics etc.) kept in separately fabricated units and are designed to be easily replaceable.\n\nMarketing by Siemens has heavily emphasised the locomotive's energy-saving characteristics, as well as the technology used to reduce particulate emissions.\n\nThe locomotives have a supercharged 16-cylinder diesel engine of the MTU 4000 series developing 2,000 kW of power which drive a three-phase brushless alternator. At idle 8 of the 16 cylinders can be turned off, reducing fuel consumption and emissions.\n\nThe three-phase electrical supply is rectified to DC to supply a pulse width modulator, which in turn generates a three-phase electrical supply to the traction motors (which are of the induction type) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the four traction motors are connected in parallel.\n\nElectrical taps from the main DC power supply also provide power to other electronically controlled power supplies, including those that power the cooling fans (also known as 'blowers') at 440 V 3-phase 60 Hz. The power supply for passenger operations (coach heating, lighting etc.) is optional and is located separately under the main frame whereas the rest of the electronic equipment is mounted in the body of the vehicle.\n\nIncludes\n\nThis package contains:\n\nDiesel Locomotive siemens ER-20 Advanced OBB-2016\nRealistic and advanced options (advanced and expert knowledge reguired)\nRealistic sound effects (recorded from the real locomotive).
