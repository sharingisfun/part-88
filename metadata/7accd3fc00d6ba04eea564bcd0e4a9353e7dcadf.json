No reason to reiterate all the accolades that have been bestowed upon this series.  The first arc &quot;More Than Rubies&quot; introduces Morpheus, the King of Dreams and embodiment of the Dreaming. Part of Gaiman's genius is his almost obsessive inclusiveness with the characters and history of the DC Universe in this series.  If ever there was a true companion piece to Crisis on Infinite Earths it is this series, but it truly is so much more.  The series is essential reading for anyone who likes good fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7accd3fc00d6ba04eea564bcd0e4a9353e7dcadf","amp;dn":"Essentials+-+Sandman+v2+%281-8%3B+1988-1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7accd3fc00d6ba04eea564bcd0e4a9353e7dcadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,204,211,252,0,214,186,4,238,165,100,188,208,228,169,53,62,125,202,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
