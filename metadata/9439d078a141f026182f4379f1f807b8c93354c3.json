It is an integral part of their marriage, child rearing, and community. In this daring new book, distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In Breaking the Spell, Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith.\n\nIn a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history, philosophy, and psychology, Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly, he contends that the &quot;belief in belief&quot; has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need.\n\nBreaking the Spell is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives, our interactions, and our country. With the gulf between rationalists and adherents of &quot;intelligent design&quot; widening daily, Dennett has written a timely and provocative book that will be read and passionately debated by believers and nonbelievers alike.\n\nFor all the thousands of books that have been written about religion, few until this one have attempted to examine it scientifically: to ask whyÃ¢â‚¬â€and howÃ¢â‚¬â€it has shaped so many lives so strongly. Is religion a product of blind evolutionary instinct or rational choice? Is it truly the best way to live a moral life? Ranging through biology, history, and psychology, Daniel C. Dennett charts religionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evolution from Ã¢â‚¬Å“wildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ folk belief to Ã¢â‚¬Å“domesticatedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dogma. Not an antireligious screed but an unblinking look beneath the veil of orthodoxy, Breaking the Spell will be read and debated by believers and skeptics alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9439d078a141f026182f4379f1f807b8c93354c3","amp;dn":"Daniel+C.+Dennett+Breaking+the+Spell+%28chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9439d078a141f026182f4379f1f807b8c93354c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,57,208,120,161,65,240,38,24,47,67,121,241,248,7,184,201,51,84,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
