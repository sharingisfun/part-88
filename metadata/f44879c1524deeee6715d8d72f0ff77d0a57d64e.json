Install, \nupdate and configure your products safely, securely and reliably.\nWith Advanced Installer, packaging and deploying SourceTree \nis now just a simple part of our development process. \nWe can focus our efforts on building new features in \nSourceTree and improving existing ones so that \nSourceTree becomes the best Windows interface \nto Git source repositories.\n\nEasy to use GUI:\nWith over 10 years of experience in creating Windows \nInstaller (MSI) setup packages and its easy to use GUI, \nAdvanced Installer Windows Installer enables users to \ninstall applications on all Windows editions. All packages \nare compliant with Active Directory/GPO policies and support \nSCCM deployment. Based on the feedback gathered from thousands \nof users Advanced Installer provides the best default \nsettings required in a professional package, reducing \nthe package development time \nneeded for such software applications as SourceTree.\n\nReliability:\nFor a tool used by hundreds of thousands of users \nevery day reliability is a key component. Advanced \nInstaller is tested daily using automated tests that \ninclude normal QA testing routines, allowing prevention \nof regression bugs and detecting problems from new features \nbefore they are distributed in an official release.\nThis saves time in handling support tickets from \nusers that have problems installing an application, \nor an update for it. Built-in prerequisites enable \napplications to be deployed fast and correctly. \nBe it that a Visual C++ redistributable, \n.NET Framework or a simple installation of \nAdobe Reader. Advanced Installer can include \nany of these packages with a simple checkbox \ntick in the setup, streamlining the installation \nprocess for users.\n\nEasy Deployment:\nIn addition, there are automatic update deployments. \nFor example, every time a new feature or bug-fix for \nSourceTree is released, the updater from Advanced \nInstaller allows Atlassian to easily deploy it to customers. \nThe updater automatically downloads and installs the \nnew version, so users don't have to visit the \nAdvanced Installer website to get updates manually. \nWith new features appearing monthly for SourceTree for Windows, \nthis feature is critical for the \napplication's installation package.\n\n\nHow To Install \n\n01: Install Advanced Installer.exe\n\n02: Clsoe The Program If running \n\n03: Copy &amp; Paste &quot;advinst.exe&quot; from 'Crack' \nfolder to the &quot;Copy Here The Crack File- Shortcut&quot; Folder\n\nOr \n\nCopy &quot;advinst.exe&quot; in &quot;Crack&quot; folder and paste it in to installation\nfolder by replacing.
