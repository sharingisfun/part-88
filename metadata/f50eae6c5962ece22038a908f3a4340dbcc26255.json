There are texts, review books, pocket guides, and individual clinical titles devoted to specific topics, but none take this approach-when complete, Rehabilitation Medicine Quick Reference series will form a clinical practice library in physiatry.\n\n\n Cancer rehabilitation is a growing area in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Cancer survivors face both physical and psychosocial issues that affect their quality of life, no matter what type of cancer they have overcome. Additionally, patients undergoing cancer treatment often require therapy to help offset the associated medical problems that emerge as a result of their treatment or the cancer itself. This book will broadly cover assessment and treatment of a multitude of rehabilitation issues as they uniquely affect cancer patients. A complete list of topics will be drawn up by the editor in consultation with the series editor, but there should be no lack of material here. Key areas include pain control, post-surgical rehabilitation, fatigue, neuropathies, bowel and bladder dysfunction, cognitive problems, spine disorders, etc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50eae6c5962ece22038a908f3a4340dbcc26255","amp;dn":"Cancer+Rehabilitation%3A+Rehabilitation+Medicine+Quick+Reference","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50eae6c5962ece22038a908f3a4340dbcc26255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,14,174,108,89,98,236,226,32,56,169,8,243,164,52,13,188,194,98,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
