Each method has its own specific performances, and limitations and they appear to be complementary rather than competitive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c69a23e621c95c7ef451ab6d02da8492aed8bb","amp;dn":"Modeling+and+Simulation+of+Turbulent+Flows+-+Roland+Schiestel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c69a23e621c95c7ef451ab6d02da8492aed8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,198,154,35,230,33,201,92,126,244,81,171,109,2,218,132,146,174,216,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
