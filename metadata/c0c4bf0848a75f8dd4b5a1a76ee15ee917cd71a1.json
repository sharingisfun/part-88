Ah, Michael Monroe and his band apparently have a second album out, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called Horns and Halos. My bad.\nAnd for the most part, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good album, if somewhat of a mixed bag. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TNT DietÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is fast, loud, throw-yourself-off-the-rafters-in-excitement rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll that almost sounds like classic Hanoi Rocks;  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saturday Night SpecialÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stained Glass HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½  prove that that Monroe is still the Energizer Bunny of punk rock, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soul SurrenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will remind you that raw, melodic punk is still his pretty much MonroeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bread and butter; and the title track and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Child of the RevolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½  are straight-up, gritty numbers with a darker tone, which make them the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standout cuts.\nIn other places, though, the album drags a bit. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ballad of the Lower East Side,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  an ode to New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dirtier years is definitely mournful in the way that only people whom have actually performed at CBGBs could be,  is deflating, redeemed only by a clap-clap-clap beat and section of swooing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hallelujah!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½s. Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Block The Sun,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the mellowest tune on Horns and Halos, is a direct contrast to the record:calm and slight, it sounds a little like Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s radio rock in the vein of Ã¢â‚¬â€ I hesitate to say it, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true!!! Ã¢â‚¬â€ a band like Gin Blossoms.\nStill, Monroe mostly avoid a sophomore slump. Bands often lose some of their steam with all the effort put into their second release, but Horns and Halos is actually a fairly respectable follow-up to 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Sensory Overdrive. A lot of the credit belongs not just with Mr. Monroe, but with his band, too. While Steve Conte, Sammi Yaffa, Karl Rockfist, and Dregen are all highly talented musicians in their own right, together with Monroe, they sometimes achieve something irresistibly good.\nock\nSubgenre:\tHard Rock / Glam Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t624.67 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n82 files\nAdded:\t20/09/2014File Name \tSize\n1987 Nights Are So Long/01.She's No Angel.mp3 \t8.09 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/02.Million Miles Away.mp3 \t8.67 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/03.Shake Some Action.mp3 \t8.69 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/04.It's A Lie.mp3 \t9.29 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/05.High School.mp3 \t7.14 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/06.Nights Are So Long.mp3 \t7.91 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/07.Can't Go Home Again.mp3 \t7.63 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/08.Too Rich To Be Good.mp3 \t7.85 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/09.You Can't Put Your Arm Around A Memory.mp3 \t3.43 MB\n1987 Nights Are So Long/10.Keep It Up.mp3 \t8.01 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/01 Dead, Jail Or Rock 'N Roll.mp3 \t10.38 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/02 While You Were Looking At Me.mp3 \t9.27 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/03 She's No Angel.mp3 \t8.87 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/04 All Night With The Lights On.mp3 \t8.88 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/05 Not Fakin'It.mp3 \t8.86 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/06 Shakedown.mp3 \t7.36 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/07 Man With No Eyes.mp3 \t9.11 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/08 Love Is Thicker Than Wood.mp3 \t9.70 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/09 Smoke Screen.mp3 \t9.36 MB\n1989 Not Fakin' It/10 Thrill Me.mp3 \t7.92 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/01_michael_monroe_always_right_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t12.27 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/02_michael_monroe_kick_out_the_jams_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t5.52 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/03_michael_monroe_loneliness_loves_me_more_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t8.99 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/04_michael_monroe_machine_gun_etiquette_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t4.40 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/05_michael_monroe_make_it_go_away_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t6.91 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/06_michael_monroe_not_anymore_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t8.33 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/07_michael_monroe_peace_of_mind_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t4.61 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/08_michael_monroe_relationship_wrecked_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t8.98 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/09_michael_monroe_rent_free_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t6.34 MB\n1996 Peace Of Mind/10_michael_monroe_wheres_the_fire_john_myzuka.ru.mp3 \t9.39 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/01 - Life Gets You Dirty.mp3 \t5.25 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/02 - Just Because You're Paranoid.mp3 \t7.14 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/03 - Since When Did You Care.mp3 \t10.03 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/04 - Self Destruction Blues.mp3 \t5.36 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/05 - Always Never Again.mp3 \t7.93 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/06 - Go Hard.mp3 \t9.18 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/07 - I Send You Back.mp3 \t10.09 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/08 - Whats With The World.mp3 \t11.40 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/09 - Love And Light.mp3 \t6.49 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/10 - If The World Dont Want Me.mp3 \t6.87 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/11 - LittleTroublemaker.mp3 \t5.68 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/12 - Not Bad For A White Boy.mp3 \t6.59 MB\n1999 Life Gets You Dirty/13 - No Means No.mp3 \t7.65 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/01 - Do Anything You Wanna Do.mp3 \t7.42 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/02 - Right Here, Right Now.mp3 \t8.02 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/03 - Stranded.mp3 \t8.81 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/04 - I Won't Lie Down And Die.mp3 \t5.35 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/05 - Shattered Smile.mp3 \t7.03 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/06 - What Love Is.mp3 \t4.55 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/07 - Rumour Sets The Woods Alight.mp3 \t6.55 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/08 - Germfree Adolescents.mp3 \t6.69 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/09 - Life's A Bith And Then You Live.mp3 \t8.02 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/10 - Telephone Bill's All Mine.mp3 \t9.02 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/11 - Jimmy Brown.mp3 \t8.53 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/12 - Identity.mp3 \t5.71 MB\n2003 Whatcha Want/13 - Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye.mp3 \t6.83 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/01 - Trick Of The Wrist.mp3 \t5.36 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/02 - '78.mp3 \t7.42 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/03 - Got Blood .mp3 \t6.03 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/04 - Superpowered Superfly.mp3 \t6.15 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/05 - Modern Day Miracle.mp3 \t6.30 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/06 - Bombs Away.mp3 \t8.20 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/07 - All You Need.mp3 \t7.12 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/08 - Later Won't Wait.mp3 \t7.57 MB\n2011 Sensory Overdrive/09 - Gone Baby Gone (Feat.
