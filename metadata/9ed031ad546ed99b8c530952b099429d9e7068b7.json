First topic - The GAO says IRS political targeting is indeed possible under current regulation despite claims to the contrary by Obama.

Kennedy asks the panel what they would do with that amount of money. Now - The sharing economy is starting to cover doctors. Get medical care with an iPhone app. \n\nJOHN BOLTON is here to talk about the growing threat of Americans radicalized by ISIS propaganda. Over blown threat or something to worry about? (Guess what John's opinion is.) Bolton uses the word &quot;intrusive&quot; when describing what he thinks out cyber security efforts should be like.\n\nTopical Storm:\nMan gets inside giant balloon, fills it with water until it pops.\nAshley Madison hacked, details starting to leak out.\nCory Feldman plays Michael Jackson cover concert at baseball game. Baseball team apologizes.\nMan caught smoking on google maps.\nMagpie loves marijuana.\n\nThe panel is back to talk about how Hillary Clinton fares when polled against her husband Bill.
