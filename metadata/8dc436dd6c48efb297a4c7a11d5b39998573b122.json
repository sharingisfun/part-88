This means there was no cropping so you may see small black bars around the picture's edge. This is exactly what is seen on the DVD source. The problem with cropping MST3Ks is that cropping based on the movie usually over-crops the SOL segments, sometimes a lot. Plus, automatically cropping can pull the picture out of its correct aspect ratio. So these encodes have no cropping, RF=20 constant quality video and AC3 passthru so the audio is identical to the DVD.\n\nHandbrake 0.10.1.6962 20150308\n\nVideo: AVC encode\nWidth 720, Anamorphic Loose, Copping Manual 0 0 0 0\nDeinterlace=Slower\nFPS 29.97 Constant, Preset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\nAudio: AC3 Passthru 192Kbps\n\nSingle releases are RHINO\nVol01 to Vol12 are RHINO\nVol13+ are SHOUT\ntitles with subs have them set off by default\nall titles have chapters\n\nBytes.........SEp.[Title].[Volume#|Single].DVDrip.[~subs].mkv\n..912,787,424 401.SpaceTravelers.Vol32.DVDrip.subs.mkv\n..793,597,415 402.TheGiantGilaMonster.Vol10.DVDrip.mkv\n1,037,447,537 404.TeenagersFromOuterSpace.Vol06.DVDrip.mkv\n1,008,736,766 406.AttackOfTheGiantLeeches.Vol06.DVDrip.mkv\n..755,291,618 407.TheKillerShrews.Vol07.DVDrip.mkv\n..904,144,953 408.HerculesUnchained.Vol07.DVDrip.mkv\n..779,692,666 409.TheIndestructibleMan.Vol11.DVDrip.mkv\n..816,151,603 410.HerculesAgainstTheMoonMen.Vol07.DVDrip.mkv\n..945,875,049 411.TheMagicSword.Vol26.DVDrip.mkv\n1,344,539,536 412.HerculesAndTheCaptiveWomen.Vol29.DVDrip.mkv\n..893,425,313 413.Manhunt.In.Space.Vol14.DVDrip.mkv\n..746,241,100 414.Tormented.Vol11.DVDrip.mkv\n..942,759,496 415.TheBeatniks.Vol17.DVDrip.mkv\n..925,172,315 417.CrashOfMoons.Vol18.DVDrip.mkv\n..907,006,284 419.TheRebelSet.Vol12.DVDrip.mkv\n..848,856,553 421.MonsterA-GoGo.Vol08.DVDrip.mkv\n1,129,736,023 422.TheDayTheEarthFroze.Vol28.DVDrip.mkv\n1,043,384,229 423.BrideOfTheMonster.Vol19.DVDrip.mkv\n..869,801,894 424.ManosTheHandsOfFate.Shout.DVDrip.mkv &lt;&lt; UPDATED\n\nBig thanks to the online MST3K community for the DVD sources, some of which are out of print or hard to find. And to the one online member in particular who made this possible: thank you!!!\n\nIf these encodes were enjoyable, you don't have the original discs and you can afford them, please consider picking up some the official MST3K DVDs. The artwork, packaging, menus and extras with the DVDs are fantastic.\n\nPlease check out other MST3K, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \n &lt;a href=&quot; https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc436dd6c48efb297a4c7a11d5b39998573b122","amp;dn":"Mystery+Science+Theater+3000+MST3K+Season04+DVDrip+AVC+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc436dd6c48efb297a4c7a11d5b39998573b122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,196,54,221,108,72,239,178,151,164,199,161,29,91,57,153,133,115,177,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
