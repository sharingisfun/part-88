Watching the girls perform on the football field helps give Kelli and Judy the clarity they need to make some cuts. Melissa Rycroft calls all the new girls together and gives them a strategy for not losing their spots on the team. In a fairy tale moment, the girls are fitted for their boots. However, some will not wear them past today. After a telling rehearsal, more cuts must be made. As Kelli and Judy release a girl from training camp, they have one of the most bizarre office moments ever as a candidate reads them a poem in anticipation of being cut. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n420","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6db6b6f4966c4296e4bb268df179b30f87b8fff","amp;dn":"+Dallas.Cowboys.Cheerleaders.Making.The.TeamS09E07.HDTV.x264.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6db6b6f4966c4296e4bb268df179b30f87b8fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,219,107,111,73,102,196,41,110,75,178,104,223,23,155,48,248,123,143,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
