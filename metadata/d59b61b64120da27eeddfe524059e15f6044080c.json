Exploring individual, medicinal, and ritual use through historic and contemporary artwork, personal accounts, and literature as well as ayurvedic, tantric, shamanic, and European folklore practices and recent pharmacological research, the authors look at the revolving cycle of acceptance and condemnation of aphrodisiacs, the qualities that incur the label of Ã¢â‚¬Å“aphrodisiac,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the role of mind and setting, and the different ways aphrodisiacs stimulate desire--either physically, through the senses and vital organs, or mentally, through heightened awareness and altered consciousness. This comprehensive guide reveals these Ã¢â‚¬Å“remedies of the love goddessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as holy remedies whose proper use can help reestablish harmony with oneself, oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partner, and the universe.\n\n\n\nBy Christian RÃƒÂ¤tsch, Claudia MÃƒÂ¼ller-Ebeling\nPublished by Park Street Press in 2013\nPDF, Retail, 736 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d59b61b64120da27eeddfe524059e15f6044080c","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Aphrodisiacs%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d59b61b64120da27eeddfe524059e15f6044080c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,155,97,182,65,32,218,39,238,221,254,82,64,89,225,95,96,68,8,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
