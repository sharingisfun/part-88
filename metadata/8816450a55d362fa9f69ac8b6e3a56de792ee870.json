The different chapters cover a number of aspects of the topic of energy generation, with a particular focus on energy generation from biomass. They presents new findings concerning engine development, process engineering, and biological and chemical conversion of biomass to fuels, and highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary approach, combining chemistry, biology and engineering research, to the use of renewable energy sources. All in all, this book provides readers with a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in renewable energy conversion, and gives an overview of the ongoing work in this field in Germany","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8816450a55d362fa9f69ac8b6e3a56de792ee870","amp;dn":"Fuels+From+Biomass+-+An+Interdisciplinary+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8816450a55d362fa9f69ac8b6e3a56de792ee870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,22,69,10,85,211,98,250,159,105,172,139,110,58,86,222,121,46,232,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
