Billy Ã¢â‚¬Å“The GreatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the reigning Junior Middleweight Champion whose unorthodox stance, the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southpaw,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ consists of an ineloquent, though brutal, display of offensive fighting... one fueled by his own feelings of inadequacy and a desperate need for love, money and fame. With a beautiful family, home and financial security, Billy is on top both in and out of the ring until a tragic accident leaves his wife dead and sends him into a downward spiral.\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nActors: Beau Knapp, Curtis &quot;50 Cent&quot; Jackson, Forest Whitaker, Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomie Harris, Oona Laurence, Rachel McAdams, Rita Ora, Victor Ortiz\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 4 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1e1a0f9a25efc37647e4c4f2228ceaafa116b6c","amp;dn":"Southpaw.+Official+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1e1a0f9a25efc37647e4c4f2228ceaafa116b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,225,160,249,162,94,252,55,100,126,76,79,34,40,206,170,250,17,107,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
