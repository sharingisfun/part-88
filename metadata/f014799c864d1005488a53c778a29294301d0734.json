Rob Zombie is a bit of both. \nWith spooky metal music that's as colorful and kitschy as its comic art, \nthe singer's solo debut bears more than a little resemblance to his band \nof many years, White Zombie. \n\nThese 13 tracks (yeah, there just had to be 13!) continue to explore \nZombie's fascination with psychotic noise, pummeling grooves, campy \nsamples, and all things horrific. \n\nInstead of just playing dictator, however, this astrocreep allows space \nfor cohorts such as guitarist Danny Lohner and drummers John Tempesta \nand Tommy Lee to shine darkly. \n\nHe also shares artistic credit for the LP's elaborate 24-page booklet. \nZombie's finely crafted disc is heavy-metal thunder that's turbocharged for the new millennium.\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; flac\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers: Front \nTags: VorbisComment\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n01.
