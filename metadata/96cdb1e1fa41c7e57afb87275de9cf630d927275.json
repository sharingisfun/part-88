They originally formed in late 2010 in Athens Ga, in stark contrast to the happy go lucky pop friendly scene at the time. Gripe play a very heavy, dark, and discordant take on hardcore.\nTheir lyrics tend to focus on negativity, oppression, Life in Poverty, and dystopian future concepts. They released a 10 song demo in 2011 titled &quot;The Future Doesn't Need You&quot; it was 10 songs of raw protest against car company budget grind and slick stadium crust over saturation.They have since added a bassist and a new singer. There follow up &quot;Pig Servant&quot; expanded on the sound without compromising any rawness or brutality.They are known for their live show intensity.File Name \tSize\n01. 7 Billion Reasons Not to Reproduce.mp3 \t4.75 MB\n02.
