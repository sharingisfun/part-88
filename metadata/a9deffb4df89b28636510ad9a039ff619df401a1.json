A renowned expert who engineers classrooms and concert halls, Cox has made a career of eradicating bizarre and unwanted sounds. But after an epiphany in the London sewers, Cox now revels in exotic noisesÃ¢â‚¬â€creaking glaciers, whispering galleries, stalactite organs, musical roads, humming dunes, seals that sound like alien angels, and a Mayan pyramid that chirps like a bird.\n\nWith forays into archaeology, neuroscience, biology, and design, Cox explains how sound is made and altered by the environment, how our body reacts to peculiar noises, and how these mysterious wonders illuminate soundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising dynamics in everyday settingsÃ¢â‚¬â€from your bedroom to the opera house","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9deffb4df89b28636510ad9a039ff619df401a1","amp;dn":"The+Sound+Book%3A+The+Science+of+the+Sonic+Wonders+of+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9deffb4df89b28636510ad9a039ff619df401a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,222,255,180,223,137,178,134,54,81,10,217,160,57,255,97,157,244,1,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
