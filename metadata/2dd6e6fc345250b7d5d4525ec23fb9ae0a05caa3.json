Brits have always taken peculiar pride in their nation of eccentrics, from trainspotters to twitchers, model railway enthusiasts to stargazers. And every hobby needs a home. \nThat's the pleasure of Shed of the Year, prying into people's back yards to see the ingenious ways they've walled up their passions. The series is broken into various categories, and opens with the Eco and Normal Sheds - although &quot;normal&quot; is a relative term. Standout designs include a man who created a sliding roof to open his telescope to the sky, and a boat-loving &quot;sheddie&quot; who built his own amphibious summer house - just in case the bottom of the garden doesn't quite feel enough away to escape intrusion.\n\n\n1)  Eco and Normal Sheds \nGeorge Clarke presents this year's competition. The first episode features normal sheds, which include a miniature railway shed, a makeshift observatory with a retractable roof and advanced telescope, a shed that doubles as a boat and a home cinema that is also home to a collection of movie memorabilia. The judges also cast their eyes over some environmentally friendly builds, including a shed shaped like an owl, a highland bothy, a geodesic dome and a building made entirely out of mud.\n\n2)  Unique and Historical Sheds \nGeorge Clarke and the judges visit the nominees in the Unique Sheds category, which include a Japanese-style treehouse, a shed built in a tree 16 metres in the air, a gothic folly and the smallest shed in the competition, which forms part of a model railway. They also examine the entries for best historical shed, including an Anglo-Saxon dwelling, a 1950s diner, a writing hut that once belonged to George Bernard Shaw and a corrugated cottage from the Second World War.\n\n3)  Pub Sheds and Budget Sheds \nGeorge introduces the nominees in the Pub Sheds category, including a pirate-themed structure, a gin distillery, a biker pub that once housed a helicopter and a nightclub with a collection of shrunken heads. He also looks at budget sheds, featuring a hillbilly hut on wheels, a garden pavilion made of firewood, a Nepalese mountain hut and a shed made from the ruins of beach huts.\n\n4)  Cabins, Studios and the Winner \nThis year's contest draws to a close as George Clarke and the team visit contenders from the Cabin and Summerhouse and Workshop and Studio categories. Among the spaces highlighted are a converted burger van, a tiny pixie-themed cabin, a mock-Tudor structure with a psychedelic interior, a state-of-the-art photographic studio, a spaced carved using a chainsaw, and an extraordinary potting shed. With the last round of visits concluded, it is then left to George and his fellow judges to determine which of the winning entries from the nine individual categories should be named the Shed of the Year.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Amazing-Spaces-Shed-of-the-Year-Series-2-Screen0.jpg&quot;
