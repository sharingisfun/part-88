The biogas handbook: Science, production and applications provides a comprehensive and systematic guide to the development and deployment of biogas supply chains and technology.\n\nFollowing a concise overview of biogas as an energy option, part one explores biomass resources and fundamental science and engineering of biogas production, including feedstock characterisation, storage and pre-treatment, and yield optimisation. Plant design, engineering, process optimisation and digestate utilisation are the focus of part two. Topics considered include the engineering and process control of biogas plants, methane emissions in biogas production, and biogas digestate quality, utilisation and land application. Finally, part three discusses international experience and best practice in biogas utilisation. Biogas cleaning and upgrading to biomethane, biomethane use as transport fuel and the generation of heat and power from biogas for stationery applications are all discussed. The book concludes with a review of market development and biomethane certification schemes.\n\nWith its distinguished editors and international team of expert contributors, The biogas handbook: Science, production and applications is a practical reference to biogas technology for process engineers, manufacturers, industrial chemists and biochemists, scientists, researchers and academics working in this field.\nProvides a concise overview of biogas as an energy option\nExplores biomass resources for production\nExamines plant design and engineering and process optimisation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64ab38e712800d155fd004719ef5b49dc9c824f","amp;dn":"The+Biogas+Handbook+-+Science%2C+Production+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64ab38e712800d155fd004719ef5b49dc9c824f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,74,179,142,113,40,0,209,85,253,0,71,25,239,91,73,220,156,130,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
