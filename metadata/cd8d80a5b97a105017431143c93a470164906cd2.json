The external model has great textures for a freemium/freeware aircraft, and they probably were going to make it payware but just dropped the project.\n\nThat's where I come in. It originally used the default FSX CRJ700 VC, which lets face it, sucks. I did quite a bit of tweaking and inserted the virtual cockpit from the Carenado Hawker 850XP that was recently released. This includes the full VC, Navigraph, and all the functionalities associated with it. I also included some of the better repaints I found across the web while working on this project. \n\nAdditionally I did quite a bit of editing on the Flight Model so it flies much more realistically. \n\nI realize this might not be for everyone, but for those craving another bizjet for fsx, this should give you a short time fix until the new Phemon 300 comes out.\n\n\nThanks and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8d80a5b97a105017431143c93a470164906cd2","amp;dn":"FSX+-+IRIS+Global+Express+XRS%3A+Carenado+Tweak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8d80a5b97a105017431143c93a470164906cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,141,128,165,185,122,16,80,23,67,17,67,201,58,71,1,100,144,108,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
