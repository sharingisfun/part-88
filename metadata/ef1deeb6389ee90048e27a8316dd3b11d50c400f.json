Awakening, the world's first compilation spotlighting females in today's extreme metal music scene! Gathered together are eleven of the most unique groups from across the planet. Featured are well known underground favorites, up &amp; coming hard to find acts, rare performances &amp; unreleased tracks all from a diverse selection of metal genres and influences. Awakening showcases some of the metal underground's most unusual bands, each with a distinct female element.\n\n\nQuote:\nHere's a truly fabulous compilation of eleven metal bands that prove oftentimes chicks can lay down the sick grind just as well as the bros. From the symphonic black metal of Italy's Opera IX to the blackened thrash of France's Witches and the USA's Deathwitch to the doomy ploddings of the Bay Area's Noothgrush and Seattle (via Norway's) Thorr's Hammer, this international who's who of ladies in metal is a well-rounded sampler of extreme music at its best, no penises needed. My personal favorite: Montreal's all-girl death/grind outfit November Grief, whose face-melting track &quot;Spine Worm&quot; could go toe-to-toe with any Cannibal Corpse song.\nBrutal! - Illogical Contraption blog\n\nFemale members:\nEbonsight (UK - black metal) : all-female\nDeathwitch (Sweden - blackened thrash) : bass, guitar\nGehenna (Norway - black metal) : keyboards\nThorr's Hammer (USA - doom) : vocals\nWitches (France - death metal) : vocals/guitar, bass\nAcrostichon (Holland - death metal) : vocals/bass\nDemonic Christ (USA - death metal) : vocals/guitar\nNovember Grief (Canada - death metal) : all-female\nNoothgrush (USA - sludge) : drummer\nDamad (USA - crust) : vocals\nOpera IX (Italy - black metal) : vocals\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tBlack Thrash\nBitrate:\tLossless\nSize:\t361.57 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n21 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1deeb6389ee90048e27a8316dd3b11d50c400f","amp;dn":"Various+-+Awakening+-+Females+In+Extreme+Music+%281997%29FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef1deeb6389ee90048e27a8316dd3b11d50c400f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,29,238,182,56,158,233,0,72,226,122,131,22,221,59,17,213,12,64,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
