The program can also adjust Windows settings to match a specific computer configuration with the intent to improve Internet speed and reduce computer startup and shutdown time. The program is intended for use on computers that run the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\nAuslogics BoostSpeed 3 was the first official release of the program, as prior versions were deemed by their developers as requiring more work to be done. It started out with limited computer optimization options and expanded to include 18 utilities combined into one computer maintenance suite in version 5.2.0.0. The publisher also made the program available in different languages, with more languages being added from version to version.[2][3]\n\nZOTAC, a Hong Kong-based hardware manufacturer, included Auslogics BoostSpeed in its ZOTAC Boost XL software bundle, which is supplied with ZOTAC's mini-computers.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93274c1a57b817aebef2b11662ad720ad4f44a0","amp;dn":"Auslogics+BoostSpeed+8.0.0.0+%2B+Full+with+Crack+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93274c1a57b817aebef2b11662ad720ad4f44a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,50,116,193,165,123,129,122,235,239,43,17,102,42,215,32,173,79,68,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
