Lyric soprano Iliana Tsakiraki, guitarist Steelianos, keyboardist Marianthi, bassist Thanos and drummer Philip Stone each bring something unique to this all-star lineup.\n\nIliana, the voice behind Meden Agan, released a highly acclaimed studio album (Erevos Aenaon) and EP (Nemesis) with the groundbreaking group before she set her sights on new horizons. She also participated in SepticfleshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest studio album, The Great Mass, which was chosen as one of the very best metal albums of 2011. She has shared the stage with Tarja Turunen, Epica, Visions Of Atlantis, Maiden United and many more. She has also performed at the last two installments of Metal Female Voices Fest; MFVF Xl saw Steelianos and Philip take the stage as well with Iliana and EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Apple.\n\nSteelianos, lead guitar, comes to the band from Keado Mores and Steelborn. He is also an accomplished solo artist, and his guitar artistry imprints his unmistakable style onto Enemy of RealityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs.\n\nPhilip Stone is also a veteran of Meden Agan; he takes the drum throne now for EOR and provides a crushing heartbeat to every measure.\n\nBass is held down by Thanos of FM RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Chthonian Alchemy, and, rounding the sound out, Marianthe on keyboards makes this band a two-woman outfit.\n\nWith the excesses of talent and experience this group has collectively, they are destined to be unstoppable!\n\nCurrently, the band is working on their debut album, which is set for release in 2014. &quot;\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nIliana - Vocals\nSteelianos - Guitars\nMarianthe - Keys\nThanos - Bass\nPhilip - Drums\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1.
