Modeling and Computation in Engineering III contains 45 technical papers from the 3rd International Conference on Modeling and Computation in Engineering (CMCE 2014, 28-29 June 2014, including 2014 Hydraulic Engineering and Environment Workshop, HEEW 2014). The conference serves as a major forum for researchers, engineers and manufacturers to share recent advances, discuss problems, and identify challenges associated with modeling technology, simulation technology and tools, computation methods and their engineering applications. The contributions showcase recent developments in the areas of civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, environmental engineering and systems engineering, and other related fields.\n\nThe contributions in this book mainly focus on advanced theories and technology related to modeling and computation in civil engineering, hydraulic structures, hydropower and management, coastal reclamation and environmental assessment, flood control, irrigation and drainage, water resources and water treatment, environmental management and sustainability, waste management and environmental protection, pollution and control, geology and geography, mechanics in engineering, numerical software and applications. Although these papers represent only modest advances toward modeling and computation problems in engineering, some of the technologies might be key factors in the success of future engineering advances. It is expected that this book will stimulate new ideas, methods and applications in ongoing engineering advances.\n\nModeling and Computation in Engineering III will be invaluable to academics and professionals in civil engineering, hydraulic engineering and environmental engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ebfbfc192fc0db86a930d1072c2cccd73774d6","amp;dn":"Modeling+and+Computation+in+Engineering+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ebfbfc192fc0db86a930d1072c2cccd73774d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,235,251,252,25,47,192,219,134,169,48,209,7,44,44,204,215,55,116,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
