From ancient Egypt and twentieth-century Paris, from Persian schoolrooms and American parlors, hundreds of youngsters have made their way into paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, and ceramics to captivate us just as they captivated the artists through whose eyes we see them. Some of our greatest masters, including Rembrandt, Rubens, Fragonard, and Houdon, have proudly given us images of their own offspring, while other artists, as diverse as Holbein and Hokusai, Chardin and van Gogh, reveal a rare sensitivity to the innocence, charm, and complexity of childhood.
