One of these is an algorithm for decoding Reed-Solomon and BoseÃ¢â‚¬â€œChaudhuriÃ¢â‚¬â€œHocquenghem codes that subsequently became known as the BerlekampÃ¢â‚¬â€œMassey Algorithm. Another is the Berlekamp algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields, whose later extensions and embellishments became widely used in symbolic manipulation systems. Other novel algorithms improved the basic methods for doing various arithmetic operations in finite fields of characteristic two. Other major research contributions in this book included a new class of Lee metric codes, and precise asymptotic results on the number of information symbols in long binary BCH codes.\nSelected chapters of the book became a standard graduate textbook. \n\nBoth practicing engineers and scholars will find this book to be of great value. \n\nReadership: Researchers in coding theory and cryptography, algebra and number theory, and software engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea012df0b92f86e73ea9f9952585ed106e28463c","amp;dn":"Algebraic+Coding+Theory+%28Revised+Edition%29+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea012df0b92f86e73ea9f9952585ed106e28463c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,1,45,240,185,47,134,231,62,169,249,149,37,133,237,16,110,40,70,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
