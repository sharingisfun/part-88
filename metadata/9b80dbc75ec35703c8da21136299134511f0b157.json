This is not a VA it is Marlo Thomas with guests.  That makes a big difference when tagging but Big Papi jsut went with what Internet said.  Hopefully you will find this okay.\n\nPlease search Big Papi Children for a bunch more children's music.  Oh, and this CD is impossible to find in torrents so grab it and seed it and keep it alive!!!\n\nEven as a kid Big Papi wanted to shag Marlo Thomas lol  Carol Channing's track is hilarious lol  convincing kids taking care of the house sucks...ruining minds across the nation!!\n\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n\n[quote=&quot;By JulieRez VINE VOICE&quot;]I think it's funny that so many reviewers who didn't like this album (and yes in the 70's they were albums) refer to those of us who DO give high reviews as hippies. I have news for you. Children of the 70s were not hippies, their parents were. I was born in the early 70s, my teenage years were in the 80s and my young adulthood was in the 90s. I really don't qualify as a hippie in any way, shape or form.\n\nHaving said that, I still have my old album, which I saved all these years because this was my absolute favorite album of all time! (I no longer have a record player, but the album lives on!) I loved these songs so much as a child. I remember the movie we used to watch in school. They are such wonderful memories. Twenty something years later, I found the cd and purchased it immediately. I now sing and play these songs for my baby. True, the songs are somewhat dated. The 70s were very big on feminism and equality - but is that such a bad message? Plus, as a child, I didn't pay attention to the message, just to the silliness and the catchy tunes. I had no idea who Alan Alda, Carol Channing, and Marlo Thomas were. When I sing these songs to my son now, it's not becaue I want to raise a budding feminist, but because I loved it so much and I would love to share my fond memories. And if he doesn't enjoy it as much as I did, that's ok too.\n\nPS - for other 30-somethings who want to relive another childhood memory - check out the School House Rock series (DVDs, Cd's etc)... another cheesy 70s tool to educate our children about grammar, science, politics, etc. (I'm sort of embarassed to admit this but most of what I know about how a bill is passed through Congress comes from the &quot;I'm just a bill&quot; song.)[/quote]\n\n[img=&quot;Marlo Thomas Free To Be...
