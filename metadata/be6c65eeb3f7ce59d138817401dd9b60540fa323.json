ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scheduled to be released on September 23, 2014 via RCA Records. It will serve as the follow-up to 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Remember MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. About the album she said:\n\n    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different expressions of me as an artist, a girl, a music lover. Earlier in my career I was just a soloist singing other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs. Now I really want to be an artist. I want to lift the people up, have fun, create a moment. I have my own visions that I want to bring to life\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s-inspired album has already spawned the Pharrell-produced single Ã¢â‚¬Å“I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Describe (The Way I Feel)Ã¢â‚¬Å“ featuring T.I. and the Timbaland-produced Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk It OutÃ¢â‚¬Å“. She also debuted her R. Kelly duet Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the BET Awards on June 29th.\n\nAlongside the pre-order the album on iTunes, Hudson unveiled the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“DangerousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as next countdown single on August 19th.\n\nThe next countdown single is the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“He AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NowhereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Iggy Azalea. It was exclusively premiered in full on BuzzFeed on Monday September 15th.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 102 MiB\nDuration                                 : 43mn 55s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : JHUD\nAlbum/Performer                          : Jennifer Hudson\nPart/Total                               : 1\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nGrouping                                 : Contemporary R &amp; B\nPerformer                                : Jennifer Hudson\nComposer                                 : Arden Altino,Lyrica Anderson,Jerry Duplessis,Zale Epstein,Jerome Harmon,Clifford Harris,Terry Hunter,Jennifer Hudson,Vanessa Kalala,Amethyst Kelly,Jacob Luttrell,Timothy Mosley,Kortney Pollard,David Taylor,James &quot;Jim Beanz&quot; Washington,Pharrell Williams\nProducer                                 : Clive Davis\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Sony Music Entertainment / (P) 2014 RCA Records, A Division Of Sony Music Entertainment\nGenre                                    : Urban AC\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nWriting library                          : LAME3.99r\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nComment                                  : Callixtus\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n2nd Genre                                : Urban Crossover\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nDuration                                 : 43mn 55s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n***TRACKLISTING***\n\n\n    1.
