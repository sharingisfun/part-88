Four experts from the Xerces Society, a world leader in conservation and environmental issues, discuss the ecology of native beneficial insects and show how you can conserve their presence on your land through conservation biocontrol -- recognizing these insects and their habitat, reducing pesticide use, protecting existing habitat, and providing new habitat. Specific solutions and strategies include creating native plant field borders, mass insectary plantings, hedgerows, cover crops, buffer strips, beetle banks, and brush piles. Step-by-step illustrated instructions for these projects and more are accompanied by stunning full-color photography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b97c94e7164278a2a87fb7cc6d9693af94dedd","amp;dn":"Farming+with+Native+Beneficial+Insects%3A+Ecological+Pest+Control+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b97c94e7164278a2a87fb7cc6d9693af94dedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,185,124,148,231,22,66,120,162,168,127,183,204,109,150,147,175,148,222,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
