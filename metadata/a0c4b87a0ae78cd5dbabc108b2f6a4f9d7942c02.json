Dobre, JosÃƒÂ© G. Sanchez Marcano (Wiley-VCH, 2007).pdf\n\nISBN 9783527306077\n\nA description of the use of computer aided modeling and simulation in the development, integration and optimization of industrial processes. The two authors elucidate the entire procedure step-by-step, from basic mathematical modeling to result interpretation and full-scale process performance analysis. They further demonstrate similitude comparisons of experimental results from different systems as a tool for broadening the applicability of the calculation methods.\nThroughout, the book adopts a very practical approach, addressing actual problems and projects likely to be encountered by the reader, as well as fundamentals and solution strategies for complex problems. It is thus equally useful for student and professional engineers and chemists involved in industrial process and production plant design, construction or upgrading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c4b87a0ae78cd5dbabc108b2f6a4f9d7942c02","amp;dn":"Chemical+Engineering+-+Modeling%2C+Simulation+and+Similitude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c4b87a0ae78cd5dbabc108b2f6a4f9d7942c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,196,184,122,10,231,140,213,219,171,193,8,178,246,164,249,215,148,44,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
