Owens was the first bona fide country star to emerge from Bakersfield, scoring a total of 15 consecutive number one hits in the mid-'60s. In the process, he provided an edgy alternative to the string-laden country-pop that was being produced during the '60s. Later in his career, his musical impact was forgotten by some as he became a television personality through the country comedy show Hee Haw. Nevertheless, several generations of musicians -- from Gram Parsons in the late '60s to Dwight Yoakam in the '80s -- were influenced by his music, which wound up being one of the blueprints for modern country music. \n\nGenre................: Country\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Curb Records\nIncluded.............: Covers, audiochecker, Log, Cue\n\n\n\nVol. 1 (1990)\n\n01.Act Naturally\n02.Streets Of Bakersfield\n03.Together Again\n04.Before You Go\n05.Made In Japan\n06.Foolin' Around\n07.I've Got A Tiger By The Tail\n08.Under Your Spell Again\n09.Think Of Me\n10.Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass\n11.Excuse Me (I Think I've Got A Heartache)\n12.Big In Vegas\n\n\nVol. 2 (1992)\n\n01.Love's Gonna Live Here\n02.Tall Dark Stranger.flac\n03.Ruby (Are You Mad At Your Man)\n04.Your Tender Loving Care\n05.Second Fiddle\n06.Johnny B.
