Ten years after the launch of the Marvel Universe, the company finally got around to creating a swamp monster in the grand tradition of Theodore Sturgeon's It and the Heap.  The idea was hatched by Stan the Man, plotted by Roy Thomas, written by Len Wein, and saw print in Marvel's black and white magazine Savage Tales #1.  However, Savage Tales was aborted as of the second issue and the Man-Thing was in limbo until 1972 when he was resurrected in a two-part story printed in Astonishing Tales.  The four color treatment helped immensely and the moss man became the lead feature in the bimonthly Adventures into Fear, and most importantly, the creature found his soul in the form of writer Steve Gerber.  Gerber quickly distinguished Man-Thing from DC Comics popular Swamp Thing, both of which were created by Len Wein, by casting Marvel's muck-man in socially conscious as well as supernatural thrillers.  Man-Thing graduated into his own comic in 1974, and it remains one of the most singular series in Marvel's history.  The monster were never better than when he was scripted by Gerber, and this torrent collects his Marvel-616 appearances from 1971-1974.
