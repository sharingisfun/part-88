Each of the three shows, which clock in around two and a half hours apiece, is chock-full of fan favorites (&quot;Alive,&quot; &quot;Even Flow,&quot; &quot;Jeremy,&quot; &quot;Daughter,&quot; &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;), including a number of covers (Victoria Williams' &quot;Crazy Mary,&quot; Tom Petty's &quot;I Won't Back Down,&quot; Mother Love Bone's &quot;Crown of Thorns,&quot; J. Frank Wilson's &quot;Last Kiss,&quot; the Who's &quot;Baba O'Riley,&quot; Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Little Wing,&quot; and Neil Young's &quot;Fuckin' Up&quot; and &quot;Rockin' in the Free World&quot;). The sets are varied, so much so that these three shows are distinct from one another, with only a handful of overlapping staples like &quot;Corduroy,&quot; &quot;Given to Fly,&quot; and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter.&quot; The back-to-back shows from 2006 (July 22 and 23) are notable for their inclusion of songs from the album Pearl Jam (2006), though only a few per show. The shows compiled on Live at the Gorge 05/06 are typical for Pearl Jam in the sense that they're high-energy, wide-ranging in material, and long, with the band jamming out many songs to the seven- or eight-minute mark. As usual, vocalist Eddie Vedder is in full command of the crowd, engaging them often with between-song banter and infusing the performances with the charisma for which he's well-known. The abundance of live Pearl Jam albums released over the years makes Live at the Gorge 05/06 less than novel. Still, it's a great package of shows that fans will want to hear, especially anyone who missed Pearl Jam on their sold-out summer 2006 tour.\nAll Music Review by Jason Birchmeier\n\n \n\nLive At The Gorge 01-Sept-2005 - CD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] I Believe In Miracles\n[02] Small Town\n[03] Off He Goes\n[04] Low Light\n[05] Man Of The Hour\n[06] I Am Mine\n[07] Crazy Mary\n[08] Black\n[09] Hard To Imagine\n\nPlay Time - 00h:48m:44s\n\nLive At The Gorge 01-Sept-2005 - CD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Given To Fly\n[02] Last Exit\n[03] Save You\n[04] Do The Evolution\n[05] Alone\n[06] Sad\n[07] Even Flow\n[08] Not For You\n[09] Corduroy\n[10] Dissident\n[11] MFC\n[12] Undone\n[13] Daughter\n[14] In My Tree\n[15] State Of Love The Trust\n[16] Alive\n[17] Porch\n\nPlay Time - 01h:19m:50s\n\nLive At The Gorge 01-Sept-2005 - CD03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Encore Break\n[02] Love Boat Captain\n[03] Insignificance\n[04] Better Man\n[05] Rearviewmirror\n[06] I Won't Back Down\n[07] Last Kiss\n[08] Crown Of Thorns\n[09] Blood\n[10] Yellow Ledbetter\n[11] Baba O'Riley\n\nPlay Time - 00h:51m:55s\n\nLive At The Gorge 22-July-2006 - CD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Wash\n[02] Corduroy\n[03] Hail Hail\n[04] World Wide Suicide\n[05] Severed Hand\n[06] Given To Fly\n[07] Small Town\n[08] Even Flow\n[09] Down\n[10] I Am Mine\n[11] Unemployable\n[12] Daughter\n[13] Gone\n[14] Black\n[15] Insignifigance\n[16] Life Wasted\n[17] Blood\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:48s\n\nLive At The Gorge 22-July-2006 - CD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Encore Break\n[02] Footsteps\n[03] Once\n[04] Alive\n[05] State Of Love And Trust\n[06] Crown Of Thorns\n[07] Leash\n[08] Porch\n[09] Last Kiss\n[10] Inside Job\n[11] Go\n[12] Baba O'Riley\n[13] Dirty Frank\n[14] Rockin' In The Free World\n[15] Yellow Ledbetter\n\nPlay Time - 01h:19m:47s\n\nLive At The Gorge 23-July-2006 - CD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Severed Hand\n[02] Corduroy\n[03] World Wide Suicide\n[04] God's Dice\n[05] Animal\n[06] Do The Evolution\n[07] In Hiding\n[08] Green Disease\n[09] Even Flow\n[10] Marker in the Sand\n[11] Wasted Reprise\n[12] Better Man\n[13] Army Reserve\n[14] Garden\n[15] Rats\n[16] Whipping\n[17] Jeremy\n[18] Why Go\n\nPlay Time - 01h:14m:51s\n\nLive At The Gorge 23-July-2006 - CD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Encore Break\n[02] I Won't Back Down\n[03] Life Wasted\n[04] Big Wave\n[05] Satan's Bed\n[06] Spin the Black Circle\n[07] Alive\n[08] Given to Fly\n[09] Little Wing\n[10] Crazy Mary\n[11] Comatose\n[12] Fuckin' Up\n[13] Yellow Ledbetter\n\nPlay Time - 01h:01m:00s\n\n[b]Total Music Play Time.......... 07h:58m:19s\nTotal File Size....................... 3.00GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
