He made his screen debut in the short film Le Beatnik et le minet (1965) and began to appear as a bit player in full-length films in the early 1970s. His performance as a young thug in Les Valseuses (1973; Going Places) brought him his first real notice, and he subsequently appeared in such major films as Bernardo BertolucciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1900 (1976), FranÃƒÂ§ois TruffautÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Le Dernier MÃƒÂ©tro (1980; The Last Metro), Loulou (1980), Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1981; The Return of Martin Guerre), Andrzej WajdaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Danton (1983), Jean de Florette (1986), and its sequel, Manon des Sources (1986; Manon of the Spring). He starred in Camille Claudel (1989), and in 1990 he won the best actor award at the Cannes film festival for his role in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990).\n\nDepardieu played a wide variety of roles, including both historical figures (from peasants to the French Revolutionary leader Georges Danton and artist Auguste Rodin) and contemporary figures (from composers to thugs). He was notable for projecting a screen image of masculine strength that was nevertheless imbued with gentleness and sensitivity. He acted in as many as six films a year, and by the late 1980s he had become the most popular actor in France and had achieved an international reputation.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, Depardieu continued his prolific acting career. His performances in the French films Le Colonel Chabert (1994; Colonel Chabert), about a soldier who returns home from war to find his wife married to another man, and Quand jÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tais chanteur (2006; The Singer), were well received in France. In La MÃƒÂ´me (2007; also released as La Vie en rose) he portrayed the nightclub impresario who discovered Edith Piaf. He later appeared as a crime boss in the true-life gangster movie LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Instinct de mort (2008; Mesrine: Killer Instinct), as the titular police detective in Claude ChabrolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thriller Bellamy (2009; Inspector Bellamy), and as a labour activist opposite frequent costar Catherine Deneuve in the comedy Potiche (2010). Depardieu also starred in American films such as Green Card (1990), My Father the Hero (1994), Crime Spree (2003), and Last Holiday (2006).\n\nLIST OF FILMS INCLUDED\n\nFrank-Etienne_vers_la_beatitude(2012)\n36 Quai des Orfevres\n1900.Novecento.1976\n1996 - Le Plus Beau MÃƒÂ©tier Du Monde\nA Farewell to Fools 2013\nA.L.Origine\nAsterix and Obelix at the Olympics\nAstÃƒÂ©rix and ObÃƒÂ©lix God Save Britannia (2012)\nBaxter, Vera Baxter\nBerenice.2000\nBimboland (1998)\nBoudu.2005\nChicken.Run.2000\nCiao Maschio aka Bye Bye Monkey (1978)\nDeux 1989\nDro?le d'endroit pour une rencontre\nEmpreintes.Fr5\nGerardDepardieu-LhommeDontLePereNeParlaitPas\nIWantToGoHome\nJe Vous Aime (1980)\nJe.N.ai.Rien.Oublie.2010\nJean de Florette (1986)\nL ingorgo\nL.Homme.Qui.Rit.2012\nLa Derniere femme.1976\nLa machine- 1995\nLa.Marque.Des.Anges.Miserere.2013\nL'Abolition\nLE CRI DU CORMORAN LE SOIR AU DESSUS DES JONQUES\nLe Garcu\nLes acteurs 2000\nLes Gaspards\nLes.Invincibles.2013\nMichou d'Auber-2007\nNiente.Puo.Fermarci.2013\nOlÃƒÂ©\nRive droite, rive gauche (1984)\nRude journÃƒÂ©e pour la reine (1973)\nSan Antonio (2004)\nThe Left-Handed Woman - Peter Handke - 1978\nThe.Big.Night.[Le.Grand.Soir].2012\nUbojnaja.sila\nUn baiser PAPILLON 2011\nUnited.Passions.2014\nUranus.1990\nViktor.2014\nWelcome.to.New.York.2014\n\nTHE GERARD DEPARDIEU COLLECTION PART 3 COMING SOON.. \n\nTHE GERARD DEPARDIEU COLLECTION PART 1 DOWNLOAD LINK \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/8386283/Gerard_Depardieu_Collection_Part_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/8386283/Gerard_Depardieu_Collection_Part_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cad6cfc1a26d0a7c920ae3145ce53410fd8622","amp;dn":"THE+GERARD+DEPARDIEU+COLLECTION+PART+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cad6cfc1a26d0a7c920ae3145ce53410fd8622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,202,214,207,193,162,109,10,124,146,10,227,20,92,229,52,16,253,134,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
