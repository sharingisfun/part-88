The enigmatic anti-hero of Riddick is famous, of course, from the runaway sleeper hit of 2000--Pitch Black--and its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. This game takes place before either of the movies, filling in some of the backstory of RiddickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark and dangerous past. Make a dramatic escape from Butcher Bay, the galaxy's deadliest prison, in this intense fusion of first-person shooter, fighter, and stealth adventure.\nThere is a rule that licensed games based on movies are typically, well, not too good. The Chronicles of Riddick does not simply break this rule, it obliterates the rule and dances on its still-warm ashes. Some even say that this game has greatly exceeded the movies it was based upon. David Twohy (the scriptwriter for both Riddick movies) and Vin Diesel both contributed to the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, assuring a maximum level of consistency with the world shown on the big screen. The level of polish is astonishing throughout the entire game. The stealth/adventure/brawler/RPG gameplay is slick and intuitive, characters are interesting and Ã¢â‚¬Å“aliveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the combat is fun and visually realistic (which is a nice way of saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“bloodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). So find for yourself it you have what it takes to not only survive in Butcher's Bay and assault the Dark Athena, the most dangerous places in the universe, but also make them bow to your will. \nThe Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes a graphically enhanced remake The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the sequel, Assault on Dark Athena.\nThis excellent game won a number of editorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choice awards from places like IGN, GameSpot, and GameSpy.\nThe main character--Riddick--is voiced and partially designed by Vin Diesel himself.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: WindowsÃ‚Â® XP/Windows VistaÃ‚Â®/Windows 7Ã‚Â®, Processor: Intel Pentium D 805 or AMD Athlon X2 +3800, RAM: 1 GB Windows XP / 2 GB Windows Vista, Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT or NVIDIA GeForce 6800 Ultra or better, Sound: DirectX 9.0c-compatible, Hard Drive Space: 11 GB.
