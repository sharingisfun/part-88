Extract using Winrar or 7-zip\n2. Cut Metal Slug folder to C:Program Files\n3. Now into C:Program FilesMetal Slug , right click mslug1.exe and send to desktop. Do this twice.\n4. Rename Metal slug desktop shortcut to Metal Slug and drag it into C:ProgramDataMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuPrograms\n5. Rename the other shortcut on desktop to Metal Slug\n\nIf you're using an xbox 360 controller, I'd recommend using my controller layout. You'll need to start the game once and then exit. Then simply copy paste UserDefault.xml into Metal SlugProfileUserSaves\nMy layout is:\nA = Jump\nX = Shoot\nB = Grenade\n\nThe game has a bug whereby it doesn't let you remap the buttons via the settings menu, you have to edit UserDefault.xml\n\n\n7z Compressed size = 36.3 MB~\nUncompressed size = 70 MB~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed54fc6042013c70c863c1bc15e5bf9e3c36a52d","amp;dn":"Metal+Slug+-+ALI213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed54fc6042013c70c863c1bc15e5bf9e3c36a52d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,84,252,96,66,1,60,112,200,99,193,188,21,229,191,158,60,54,165,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
