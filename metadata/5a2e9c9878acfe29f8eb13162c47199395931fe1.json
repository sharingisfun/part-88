Eschewing the convoluted narrative structures of earlier work (like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cherry HustlersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good Girl, Bad GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the latter a particularly dense carnal update of Otto PremingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“LauraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), he allows plenty of time for fan favorites such as Nina Hartley, Danielle (sometimes Danielle Martin) and Lili Marlene to strut their stuff sexually, capturing everything with customary crystal-clear camera-work, reminding us that his reputation as a DoP has always outshone his directorial credit.\nA dress that once belonged to legendary screen sex goddess Mae West turns up in a thrift store run by Monica (British Paula Meadows, excellent in Lasse BraunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young NymphoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Margie (the incomparable Nina Hartley exuding class from every pore on that gorgeously tanned body) and basically assures that everyone who sees it wants to, er, get it on. First up is dressmaker Claire (Lili Marlene) who practically rapes her male assistant (Alan Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Adrian) on the spot in an impressive display of pure animal lust. Not to be outdone, shop girl Debbie (Danielle, once christened Ã¢â‚¬Å“the woman who was born hotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by late genre critic Jim Holliday) puts the frock on herself and hurls herself at unsuspecting buyer Robert Bullock (the memorably tortured leading man in Chuck VincentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“VoyeurÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). He passes it on to colleague Jean (pleasingly pudgy Taija Rae) who uses it to wow her upper-class fiancÃƒÂ© (Paul Thomas at his most pompous), much to the dismay of his even stuffier sister (a very funny turn by Sharon Kane) who willfully ruins the discarded gown by mopping up spilt booze.\nDry-cleaned and returned to the shop, it then prompts a ladies only interlude between Hartley and Meadows, before being whisked off to perverted society matron Charlie Latour (a minor New York actress in features such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThunderstormÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silence of the GamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, sort of a poor manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chelsea Blake) who puts it on her toy boy David Morris for their weekly role-playing session. Then Claire comes to realize that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a case of mistaken identities (or mixed-up garments at any rate) and that the dress never belonged to Mae West at all. She does come into possession of another one that did however and passes it on to Margie and Monica just in time for their tax audit, turning it into a small orgy (six participants) that gets the money men temporarily off their backs.\nElegantly produced and rapidly paced, this is a most enjoyable carnal comedy that has some funny and well-delivered dialog mixed in with some highly charged sexual situations. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just enough plot to conveniently connect Point A to Point B without getting in the way of the audience having a good time. Looks like Dorfman has finally relaxed enough to allow for at least one really good sex flick to illuminate his rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©.  \n- Video Tramp Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Scene 1.
