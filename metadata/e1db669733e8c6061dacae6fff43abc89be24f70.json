Addressing methods that examine the structures and properties of materials over length scales ranging from local atomic order to long-range order on the meso- and macro-scopic scales, Multi Length-Scale Characterisation contains five detailed chapters: \n\nMeasurement of Bulk Magnetic Properties\nThermal Methods\nAtomic Force Microscopy\nGas Sorption in the Analysis of Nanoporous Solids\nDynamic Light Scattering\nIdeal as a complementary reference work to other volumes in the series (Local Structural Characterisation and Structure from Diffraction Methods) or as an examination of the specific characterisation techniques in their own right, Multi Length-Scale Characterisation is a valuable addition to the Inorganic Materials Series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1db669733e8c6061dacae6fff43abc89be24f70","amp;dn":"Multi+length-scale+characterisation+%28Inorganic+Materials+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1db669733e8c6061dacae6fff43abc89be24f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,219,102,151,51,232,198,6,29,172,174,111,255,67,171,200,155,226,79,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
