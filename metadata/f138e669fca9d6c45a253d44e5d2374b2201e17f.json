Whilst EMDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SD40-2 was more reliable, GEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line included locomotives up to 3,600hp (2,685kW) with more modern technology.\n\nEMDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had already established a track record for producing 3,600hp locomotives, with the SD45 and SD45-2; however, demand for these gas guzzlers dropped sharply after the 1970s fuel crises. The SD50 was heavily updated, with a new V16 engine uprated with more horsepower. Unfortunately, this proved to be an unsuccessful move as the 50 series models were plagued by engine and electrical system problems.\n\nThe SD50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s long hood saw changes from previous EMD models; the overall frame length was increased, and the long hood was made substantially longer. Resistors for the dynamic brake grid were also moved to a new, cooler location in front of the engine compartment air intakes, thereby simplifying the prime mover maintenance procedures, and the electrical system as well.\n\nThe EMD SD50 for Train Simulator, developed by Digital Train Model, is available in Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad livery and features engine start/stop, dynamic brakes, front and rear headlights, numberboard lights, class lights and step lights.\n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the D&amp;RGW SD50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Soldier Summit route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\nScenarios\nFour scenarios for the Soldier Summit route:\n\nIndustrial Operation\nGreen River\nHigher Priority\nThe Storm and the Rock Slide\n\n&lt; THIS WORKS IN PIRATED AND LEGIT TS2015 &gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f138e669fca9d6c45a253d44e5d2374b2201e17f","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+-+D%26amp%3BRGW+SD50","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f138e669fca9d6c45a253d44e5d2374b2201e17f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,56,230,105,252,169,214,196,90,37,61,68,229,210,55,75,34,1,225,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
