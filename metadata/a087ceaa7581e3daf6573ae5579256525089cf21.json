Thus, you can spend less time looking for things and change how information is displayed according to your circumstances. \nThis feature appeared first in Start Menu X and is our invention.\nThe group can be folded and its contents can be accessed by passing the cursor over it. \t\nThe group can be unfolded and display the contents right in the menu.\n\n...Smart list of popular apps and programs.\nThis list contains frequently used applications, e.g. the applications that you launched most recently. \nThanks to a smart algorithm, we've been able to make it so the applications you use the most are always at your fingertips. \nThis list combines both standard applications and Windows 8 apps.\n\n...Access to anywhere on your computer\nUnfortunately, in Windows 10, links to folders were removed from the system menu. \nYou are only given a list of applications, so even getting to the control panel from the menu has become very difficult.\nIt's a good thing you have Start Menu 10! \nWith our program you can configure a customized list of folders. \nA broad selection of 25 system folders and the ability to add your own folders or applications are what you need to tailor the menu to your individual needs.\n\n\n...Fullscreen list of application\nThe Windows 10 system menu and other applications that thoughtlessly copied the Windows 7 menu force you to use a small window to select applications. \nConsequently, you have to constantly scroll through this list and make lots of superfluous mouse movements.\nWe have fixed this annoyance in the interface. \nFolder contents make use of the entire screen and selecting an application only depends on how fast your eyes are. \nWhen combined with the &quot;one-click launch&quot; feature, the results are stunning.\n\n \t\n...Timer-based power management\nWithout any additional applications or effort, directly from the menu you can set a timer to shut down or sleep your computer with a delay. \nThis feature is helpful for folks who love to leave the computer on at night to work on resource-intensive tasks and those who just love to listen to music while they're out and about","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a087ceaa7581e3daf6573ae5579256525089cf21","amp;dn":"Start+Menu+10+PRO+v5.55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a087ceaa7581e3daf6573ae5579256525089cf21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,135,206,170,117,129,227,218,246,87,58,229,87,146,86,82,80,137,207,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
