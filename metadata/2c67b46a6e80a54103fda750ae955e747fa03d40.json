Herb, a young entrepreneur, returns to the isolated planet on which he has illegally been trying to build a city-and finds it destroyed by a swarming nightmare of self-replicating machinery. Worse, the all-seeing Environment Agency has been watching him the entire time. His punishment? A nearly hopeless battle in the farthest reaches of the universe against enemy machines twice as fast, and twice as deadly, as his own-in the company of a disarmingly confident AI who may not be exactly what he claims...\nLittle does Herb know that this war of machines was set in motion nearly two hundred years ago-by mankind itself. For it was then that a not-quite-chance encounter brought a confused young girl and a nearly omnipotent AI together in one fateful moment that may have changed the course of humanity forever.\n\nCapacity (AI Trilogy #2)\nWelcome to the year 2252Ã¢â‚¬â€and congratulations! YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now a personality construct. We know that can be a daunting stage of personal development, especially if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember making this life-changing decision. But weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re here to helpÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nHelen is waking to a dark new realityÃ¢â‚¬â€one that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t choose. In this borrowed existence, she finds an unexpected guide in Judy, a geisha-faced virgin whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on a mission of her own. Together, the two of them begin a dangerous run through dozens of imagined worlds in an attempt to trap a psychopath haunting the shadowed areas of virtual spaceÃ¢â‚¬â€a killer who brutally murdered an earlier version of Helen and who plans to kill again. Meanwhile, Justinian is investigating a peculiar rash of AI suicides on far-off planetsÃ¢â‚¬â€and finds that not only is there more to these Ã¢â‚¬Å“deathsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ than he thought, but that they may be linked to his wife AnyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysterious coma.\n\nIn a future where AIs have taken over human life and the Environment Agency runs everything for our own good, the fact that we can live on after physical death as sentient digital beings should have been a good thing. Instead, as Helen and Justinian are about to discover, it just means there are more ways to die.\n\nDivergence (AI Trilogy #3) \nAfter a tumultuous beginning, mid-23rd-century Earth now peacefully operates under the constant surveillance of the Watcher, an all-seeing AI who has seized control of the planetÃ¢â‚¬â€and of the minds and bodies of its people. But is the radical evolution that the Watcher has in mind a step forward or the beginning of a mighty split that will cast aside everything that truly makes us human?\n\nIt is 2252, and Judy is traveling on a passenger ship in deep space when disaster strikes. Almost too conveniently, strange machines appear onboard just in time to help. They are owned by DIANA, a commercial organization headquartered on Earth. But as the machines arrange for the humans to be taken to safety, Judy is held back. They have detected something in her genetic codeÃ¢â‚¬â€something shocking: Judy is not human. And she too is the property of DIANA.\n\nNow Judy must return to Earth to find out what DIANA expects of herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦how she was grownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and why she was destined to destroy the Watcher. But is this Judy even the same person? And does the new Judy have a reason to destroyÃ¢â‚¬â€or is she just a pawn in someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderous game?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c67b46a6e80a54103fda750ae955e747fa03d40","amp;dn":"AI+Trilogy+%28Complete%29+by+Tony+Ballantyne+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c67b46a6e80a54103fda750ae955e747fa03d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,103,180,106,110,128,165,65,3,253,167,80,174,149,94,116,127,160,61,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
