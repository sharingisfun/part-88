In Several Short Sentences About Writing, he sets out to help us unlearn that Ã¢â‚¬Å“wisdomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€about genius, about creativity, about writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s block, topic sentences, and outlineÃ¢â‚¬â€and understand that writing is just as much about thinking, noticing, and learning what it means to be involved in the act of writing. There is no gospel, no orthodoxy, no dogma in this book. Instead it is a gathering of starting points in a journey toward lively, lucid, satisfying self-expression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3235a8fff8dcef6e34c016146b82f9dcecf80b4","amp;dn":"Verlyn+Klinkenborg+-++Several+Short+Sentences+About+Writing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3235a8fff8dcef6e34c016146b82f9dcecf80b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,35,90,143,255,141,206,246,227,76,1,97,70,184,47,157,206,207,128,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
