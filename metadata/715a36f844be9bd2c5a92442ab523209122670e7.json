There is a wiki for this series with many details. In these fileshares I will not repeat a lot of that.\n\nFrom the wiki\n\nJohnny Staccato is an American private detective series starring John Cassavetes which ran for 27 episodes on NBC from September 10, 1959 through March 24, 1960.\n\n1-27 \t&quot;Swinging Long Hair&quot; \tMarch 17, 1960 \tStaccato is mistaken for a concert pianist who has come to the United States to avoid his repressive government.\n\nThanks to &quot;The Executive&quot; who gave me the idea to add this television series.  Doing the episodes singly provides for a faster download and quicker view.\n\nPlease add this series to other indexes and support filesharing by seeding to others.\n\nThis series is currently available in a boxed set for purchase at Timeless Media Group.\n\nThis is the last and finale of the Johnny Staccato series.  It was created in 1959 when the major stuggle for civil rights of black people was just beginning.  Very few black performers appear in this program about the &quot;jazz detective.&quot;  But Cassavetes would go on to star with Sidney Poitier in the David Susskind film &quot;Edge of the City,&quot; notable for it's bold interracial themes.\n\nAlso I'll summarize the episodes which Cassavetes directed.  I've noted 'directed by' in the naming of these torrents in later episodes.\n\nHere are the five episodes which John Cassavetes directed:\n \nEpisode   2  &quot;Murder for Credit&quot;\n\n\nEpisode   7  &quot;Evil&quot;\n\n\nEpisode  13  &quot;A Piece of Paradise&quot;\n\n  \nEpisode  19  &quot;Night of Jeopardy&quot;\n\n\nEpisode  22  &quot;Solomon&quot; \n\n\nNotes written July 30h, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:715a36f844be9bd2c5a92442ab523209122670e7","amp;dn":"Johnny+Staccato+%281959%29+1-27+guest+star+George+Voskovec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"715a36f844be9bd2c5a92442ab523209122670e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,90,54,248,68,190,155,210,197,169,36,66,171,82,50,9,18,38,112,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
