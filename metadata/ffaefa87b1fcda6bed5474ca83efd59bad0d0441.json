Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Nanoribbon Interconnects explores two new important carbon nanomaterials, carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene nanoribbon (GNR), and compares them with that of copper-based interconnects. These nanomaterials show almost 1,000 times more current-carrying capacity and significantly higher mean free path than copper. Due to their remarkable properties, CNT and GNR could soon replace traditional copper interconnects. Dedicated to proving their benefits, this book covers the basic theory of CNT and GNR, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the CNT- and GNR-based VLSI interconnects at nanometric dimensions.\n\n\n\nExplore the Potential Applications of CNT and Graphene for VLSI Circuits\n\n\nThe book starts off with a brief introduction of carbon nanomaterials, discusses the latest research, and details the modeling and analysis of CNT and GNR interconnects. It also describes the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and structural behavior of these materials. In addition, it chronicles the progression of these fundamental properties, explores possible engineering applications and growth technologies, and considers applications for CNT and GNR apart from their use in VLSI circuits.\n\n\n\nComprising eight chapters this text:\n\nCovers the basics of carbon nanotube and graphene nanoribbon\n\nDiscusses the growth and characterization of carbon nanotube and graphene nanoribbon\n\nPresents the modeling of CNT and GNR as future VLSI interconnects\n\nExamines the applicability of CNT and GNR in terms of several analysis works\n\nAddresses the timing and frequency response of the CNT and GNR interconnects\n\nExplores the signal integrity analysis for CNT and GNR interconnects\n\nModels and analyzes the applicability of CNT and GNR as power interconnects\n\nConsiders the future scope of CNT and GNR\n\n\n\nBeneficial to VLSI designers working in this area, Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Nanoribbon Interconnects provides a complete understanding of carbon-based materials and interconnect technology, and equips the reader with sufficient knowledge about the future scope of research and development for this emerging topic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffaefa87b1fcda6bed5474ca83efd59bad0d0441","amp;dn":"Carbon+Nanotube+and+Graphene+Nanoribbon+Interconnects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffaefa87b1fcda6bed5474ca83efd59bad0d0441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,174,250,135,177,252,218,107,237,84,116,202,131,239,213,155,173,13,4,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
