New additions to the second edition include five new topic and exercise chapters on soilborne pathogens, molecular tools, biocontrol, and plant-fungal interactions, information on in vitro pathology, an appendix on plant pathology careers, and how to use and care for the microscope. An accompanying cd-rom contains figures from the text as well as supplemental full-color photos and PowerPoint slides.\n\nUnique Learning Tools\n\nRetaining the informal style of the previous edition, this volume begins each topic with a concept box to highlight important ideas. Several laboratory exercises support each topic and cater to a wide range of skill sets from basic to complex. Procedure boxes for the experimental exercises give detailed outlines and comments on the experiments, step by step instruction, anticipated results, and thought provoking questions. Case studies of specific diseases and processes are presented as a bulleted list supplying essential information at a glance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d9812133f7597a52ea9d93037d2635ec5f6a9c4","amp;dn":"Plant+Pathology+Concepts+and+Laboratory+Exercises","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d9812133f7597a52ea9d93037d2635ec5f6a9c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,152,18,19,63,117,151,165,46,169,217,48,55,210,99,94,197,246,169,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
