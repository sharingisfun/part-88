It is also the first PokÃƒÂ©mon game to have 3D functions. The player controls a young trainer who goes on a quest to catch and train creatures known as PokÃƒÂ©mon, and win battles against other trainers. By defeating enemy PokÃƒÂ©mon in turn-based battles, the player's PokÃƒÂ©mon gains experience, allowing them to level up and increase their battle statistics, learn new battle techniques, and in some cases, evolve into more powerful PokÃƒÂ©mon. Alternatively, players can capture wild PokÃƒÂ©mon, found during random encounters, by weakening them in battle and catching them with PokÃƒÂ© Balls, allowing them to be added to their party. Players are also able to battle and trade PokÃƒÂ©mon with other human players using the Nintendo 3DS's connectivity features. Like in previous games in the series, certain PokÃƒÂ©mon are only obtainable in either X or Y, with players encouraged to trade with others in order to obtain all PokÃƒÂ©mon from both versions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da97692bb54d10e4705144d91ddcfec081cf2cad","amp;dn":"Pokemon.Y.3DS-PC-CONTRAST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da97692bb54d10e4705144d91ddcfec081cf2cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,151,105,43,181,77,16,228,112,81,68,217,29,220,254,192,129,207,44,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
