Germain Bazin, recognizing the complexity of his subject, makes no attempt to reduce it to an artificial unity. Rather, as he says, it was an age rich with all the potentials of Western artistic culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f901b30c8ba11751b05d53623c41907ae3452204","amp;dn":"The+Baroque+-+Principles%2C+Styles%2C+Modes%2C+Themes+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f901b30c8ba11751b05d53623c41907ae3452204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,1,179,12,139,161,23,81,176,93,83,98,60,65,144,122,227,69,34,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
