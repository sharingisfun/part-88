Intelligent environmental sensing uses novel sensor techniques, intelligent signal and data processing algorithms, and wireless sensor networks to enhance environmental sensing and monitoring. It finds applications in many environmental problems such as oil and gas, water quality, and agriculture. This book addresses issues related to three main approaches to intelligent environmental sensing and discusses their latest technological developments. Key contents of the book include:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Agricultural monitoring\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Classification, detection, and estimation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Data fusion\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Geological monitoring\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Motor monitoring\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multi-sensor systems\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Oil reservoirs monitoring\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sensor motes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Water quality monitoring\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wireless sensor network protocol","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6f3d32479ab1be2e736d56c0d9a246002f6381","amp;dn":"Intelligent+Environmental+Sensing+-+Smart+Sensors%2C+Measurement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6f3d32479ab1be2e736d56c0d9a246002f6381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,111,61,50,71,154,177,190,46,115,109,86,192,217,162,70,0,47,99,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
