The end titles are appropriately clamorous and bombastic, while &quot;Minxie's Dream, No. 1&quot; and &quot;No. 2&quot; drift in an eerie ether. Sure, there are the usual plucking, racing violins that suggest the sound of spiders crawling all over your back. But if that effect wasn't used on a horror movie soundtrack, there would inevitably be complaints that it was missing. That's the nice thing about Salvay's work here -- even though you know you've heard it all before, you also know you were just as scared when you did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba74f09aba68858d184df31a2285e623fa20730","amp;dn":"Jeepers+Creepers+2+OST+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba74f09aba68858d184df31a2285e623fa20730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,167,79,9,171,166,136,88,209,132,223,49,162,40,94,98,63,162,7,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
