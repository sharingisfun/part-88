Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nNO OFFENSE\n\nFriday at 9PM ET on FBN\n\nWATCH YOUR MOUTH! It's hard to stay out of trouble because the PC police are so aggressive about what words are acceptable.\n\nAMERICA, THE OFFENDED: Do you know the politically correct word for someone who is ugly? Fat? Producer Rikki Ratliff went to Times Square to give people a politically correct quiz.\n\nOH NO YOU DIDN'T! What is the politically correct term for blacks? Columnist Deroy Murdock says &quot;African-American&quot; is an awful term, and only people obsessed with race use it.\n\nVERY FUNNY : One weapon against the speech police has been comedy. A joke is often funny because it breaks the rules. &quot;The Death of Cool&quot; author Gavin McInnes says political correctness smothers comedy.\n\nACADEMIC CENSORSHIP: College is supposed to prepare you for the real world. But college is anything but the real world. Students are coddled and university administrators jump through hoops not to offend them.\n\nOFFICE SENSITIVITY: We have to be careful what we say to our co-workers. How careful? One article explains: You must never use &quot;man&quot; words like &quot;man-power.&quot; You must say &quot;work-power&quot; or &quot;staff.&quot; You must never say &quot;manmade,&quot; it's &quot;synthetic.&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: I made a career of confronting people, and sometimes that means saying offensive things. I say nasty things sometimes because sometimes truth comes out of it. We learn through confrontation. Science blossomed in America because here, no central authority, no governor, no judge, no Imam can tell people: You may not say that! Ideas compete for acceptance and usually... eventually... better ideas win.\n\nFriday at 9PM ET on the Fox Business Network\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.05.22.No.Offense.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 185 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9624b622f745bbfc6d9e39de6526f043eaf3cc","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.05.22.No.Offense.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9624b622f745bbfc6d9e39de6526f043eaf3cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,150,36,182,34,247,69,187,252,109,158,57,222,101,38,240,67,234,243,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
