The band has sold more than 10 million copies of albums worldwide.\nFinding the Sacred Heart: Live in Philly 1986 captures Dio's heavy metal antics in full swing in a live performance at the Spectrum in Philadelphia on June 17, 1986. Although Dio are touring to promote the mediocre Sacred Heart album, the show is a classic of the era, full of lasers, explosives, and a massive robotic dragon overlooking the stage. Along with songs taken from Ronnie James Dio's previous time in Black Sabbath and Rainbow, material stems from the first three Dio albums, and it's a high-quality listening experience all around. The music side is good, but ideally, the video is worth owning because it contains one of the finest visual moments in hair metal. During the five-minute breakdown of &quot;Sacred Heart,&quot; Ronnie James slays the roaring dragon with a giant light saber. Glorious.\n\nTrack Listing - Disc 1\n\nDraco Ignis\nKing of Rock and Roll\nLike the Beat of a Heart\nDon't Talk to Strangers\nHungry for Heaven\nThe Last in Line/Children of the Sea/Holy Diver\nDrum Solo\nHeaven and Hell\nKeyboard Solo\nGuitar Solo\n\n\nTrack Listing - Disc 2\n\nSacred Heart\nRock 'n' Roll Children/Long Live Rock 'n' Roll/Man on the Silver Mountain\nTime to Burn\nStand Up and Shout\nRainbow in the Dark\nWe Rock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc3104b7e311766fc8bd7c149204ec8c3f1d03f","amp;dn":"DIO+-+Finding+The+Sacred+Heart+%3A+Live+In+Philly+mp3+320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc3104b7e311766fc8bd7c149204ec8c3f1d03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,195,16,75,126,49,23,102,252,139,215,193,73,32,78,200,195,241,208,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
