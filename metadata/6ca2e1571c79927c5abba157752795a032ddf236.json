An international panel of 138 coastal experts provides information on Ã¢â‚¬Å“what is whereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on each sector of coast, together with explanations of the landforms, their evolution and the changes taking place on them. As well as providing details on the coastal features of each country (state or county) the compendium can be used to determine the extent of particular features along the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coasts and to investigate comparisons and contrasts between various world regions. With more than 1440 color illustrations and photos, it is particularly useful as a source of information prior to researching or just visiting a sector of coast. References are provided to the current literature on coastal evolution and coastline changes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca2e1571c79927c5abba157752795a032ddf236","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+the+World%27s+Coastal+Landforms+-+1st+Ed+-+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca2e1571c79927c5abba157752795a032ddf236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,162,225,87,28,121,146,124,90,187,161,87,117,39,149,160,50,221,242,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
