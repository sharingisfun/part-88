His leg has grown out of proportion to his tiny frame and he's found it hard to get around, never mind joining in with other kids. In his mind there's only one way to cure the problem - amputation. But can a young boy persuade the medical establishment to cut his leg off, and is it even in his best interests?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b11c49dbcdf29d8701c2c964c16000c0741830f","amp;dn":"iPlayer+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b11c49dbcdf29d8701c2c964c16000c0741830f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,17,196,157,188,223,41,216,112,28,44,150,76,22,0,12,7,65,131,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
