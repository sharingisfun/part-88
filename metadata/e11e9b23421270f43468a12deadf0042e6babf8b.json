When Diana is found dead outside her apartment, Ben's infatuation drives him on a hunt to find out what happened to the love of his life. Ben soon discovers that the woman he pined for was hiding a shocking double life. And now someone is out to stop Ben from uncovering the truth about Diana's illicit affairs. In his most heart-pumping thriller yet, James Patterson plunges us into the depths of a mind tortured by paranoia and obsession, on an action-packed chase through a world of danger and deceit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11e9b23421270f43468a12deadf0042e6babf8b","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+Mistress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11e9b23421270f43468a12deadf0042e6babf8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,30,155,35,66,18,112,244,52,104,161,45,234,223,0,66,230,186,191,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
