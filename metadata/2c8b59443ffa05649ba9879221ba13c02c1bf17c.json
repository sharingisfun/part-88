Pushed by his controlling and ambitious mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) to seek the exalted and powerful position of Consul, he is loath to ingratiate himself with the masses whose votes he needs in order to secure the office. When the public refuses to support him, Coriolanus's anger prompts a riot that culminates in his expulsion from Rome. The banished hero then allies himself with his sworn enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) to take his revenge on the city.\n\n---------------\n\nSample included\n\n---------------\n\nEnjoy\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8b59443ffa05649ba9879221ba13c02c1bf17c","amp;dn":"Coriolanus.2011.BDrip.720p.x264-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c8b59443ffa05649ba9879221ba13c02c1bf17c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,139,89,68,63,250,5,100,155,169,135,146,33,186,19,192,44,27,241,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
