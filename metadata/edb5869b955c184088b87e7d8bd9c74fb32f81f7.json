The coverage includes, but is not limited to, the complex mechanical and leakage behavior of gaskets and gasketed joints; instructions for choosing proper gaskets based on hands-on experience and a computer-based selection approach; evaluation of mehods for testing gaskets; comparisons of flanged joint design rules for the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code using the Taylor Forge form; and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb5869b955c184088b87e7d8bd9c74fb32f81f7","amp;dn":"Gaskets+and+Gasketed+Joints%09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb5869b955c184088b87e7d8bd9c74fb32f81f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,181,134,155,149,92,24,64,136,184,126,125,139,217,199,79,179,47,129,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
