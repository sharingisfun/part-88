But can the Devil really die? Alerted by an attack on Lux, his L.A. piano bar, Lucifer follows a trail that leads him from the mercurial realm of the Dreaming to the luminous streets of Beijing. It's up to The Morningstar to fight his most difficult battle, of body and spirit, as he falls into the jaws of a trap that doesn't even exist until it's sprung.\n\nWith a fully-painted cover by Jon J. Muth, this is a stand-alone Lucifer special.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877b2cf8d3f755649ff9bba124e3f96d4a3d62f3","amp;dn":"Lucifer_-_Nirvana_%282002%29_%28digital%29_%28Son_of_Ultron-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877b2cf8d3f755649ff9bba124e3f96d4a3d62f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,123,44,248,211,247,85,100,159,249,187,161,36,227,249,109,74,61,98,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
