But the set is better than good. It is faster and looser, a hotter show. Two-and-a-half months after Valentines Day, many more acoustic promo-gigs later, Hole had it in for us even more.\n\nWhy then you must witness to the still missing number from MTV Unplugged, &quot;Drunk In Rio&quot; aka &quot;Closing Time.&quot; That like-a-virgin song does make the cut at Virgin Megastore. The song is written by Kurt, Kristen and Courtney. She dedicates it &quot;to both of them who are not around anymore, well actually all three of 'em.&quot; \n\n...Right between the eyes of my heart. &quot;Closing Time&quot; makes it on time at last, closing down that show with no mercy.\n\n\n- Email Sent: Thu, Aug 30, 2012 &quot;Dear Jenny, Just listened to Virgin Megastore, London, UK: &quot;Drown Soda.&quot; ...Blazing. \n\nOn the 1994-1995 tour she sings and screams like no one I have ever heard before or since. So direct. Kurt was intense like that. But he never gave as much of himself away as this. But then no one has. I am sure they have but while still in tune? She sings like her life depends on it. She is putting on a show but it's real. I don't know. It's a feeling I get, that I have. \n\nI guess the interest isn't there but there should be full shows from that era available to the public. Hell, at least one. Not that the hall Of fame means shit really, but she belongs in it for this tour alone. Anyway, my way of saying thanks again.\n\n\n- 2013-01-18... There is a commercial, grunge/modern rock station in Boston on my car radio. They play Nirvana, of course. They never ever play Hole. But then they never play women artists. But neither does the local, classic rock station. Radio doesn't radiate, rate at all with me. Only thing it is good for is that makes this guy want to listen at home exclusively to women.  \n\nHearing Old Age so ageless here in my old forgotten age is so amazing.\n\nCourtney here she is in flying form above rarified air even for her.\n\nNo holes barred it's so almighty Closing Time: 1990's Courtney. As good as or better than any man. Greatest front-woman, rock-goddess ever. No one else even comes close. If only she would... \n\nOh, here she comes undone just way too much fun inside me and you again and again now now. \n\n.Hole. .Dig in.\n\n________________\n\n\n\nSome assorted art...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877929.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877929.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878073.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878073.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878046.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878046.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878015.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303878015.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877993.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877993.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877966.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-2793652-1303877966.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-4661761-1371425439-7831.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-4661761-1371425439-7831.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-4661761-1381606462-4139.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-4661761-1381606462-4139.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nX marks the Hole here in my money honey way mouth for you...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11062462/Hole_-_Burn_Trents_Computer_[Milwaukee_1994_-_open_for_NIN]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11062462/Hole_-_Burn_Trents_Computer_[Milwaukee_1994_-_open_for_NIN]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11023433/Hole_-_MTV_Unplugged__1995-02-14_(Unplugged__amp__More_-_SBD_CD)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11023433/Hole_-_MTV_Unplugged__1995-02-14_(Unplugged__amp__More_-_SBD_CD)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10726130/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Vengeance_Is_Mine_(1995_Radio_Live&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10726130/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Vengeance_Is_Mine_(1995_Radio_Live&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10676321/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Courtney_Act_(1990-93_Unreleased_SBD)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10676321/Hole_(Courtney_Love)_-_Courtney_Act_(1990-93_Unreleased_SBD)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9948319/Hole_-_Reading_Festival___Hollywood_Palladium_1994_-_Pre-FM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9948319/Hole_-_Reading_Festival___Hollywood_Palladium_1994_-_Pre-FM&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ad285040205cf1f1005607c246e5a54f28da71e","amp;dn":"Hole+-+Asking+For+It+%28Acoustic+Virgin+Megastore+London+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ad285040205cf1f1005607c246e5a54f28da71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,210,133,4,2,5,207,31,16,5,96,124,36,110,90,84,242,141,167,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
