Armed with his SB7 Spirit Box, a recording device well-known by devotees of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghost AdventuresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series, Bagans has encountered inhabitants of the spirit world during his paranormal investigations, reached out to communicate with and question them, and then, when a spirit chose to communicate, he recorded the spiritsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EVPs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d3441e528635ea602697fdbb3b6a32e19d3bbcb","amp;dn":"Zak+Bagans+vs+Praga+Khan+%26ndash%3B+NecroFusion+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d3441e528635ea602697fdbb3b6a32e19d3bbcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,52,65,229,40,99,94,166,2,105,127,219,179,182,163,46,25,211,187,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
