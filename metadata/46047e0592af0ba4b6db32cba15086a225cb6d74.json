Released the same year as Nevermind, female lead singer Inger Lorre shares Kurt Cobain's sense of angst, a sense that was absent from most glam. \nIn &quot;Wasting My Days,&quot; Lorre sings, &quot;Talk to myself, cuz I'm the only one that understands,&quot; deviating from typical male glam topics like sex and partying. Like Nevermind, this album has a punk rock influence (Iggy Pop even makes a cameo on &quot;Supersonic&quot;), but guitarists Jet and Sam Merrick don't hesitate to play effects-heavy riffs. The music matches Lorre's lyrics: the druggy world of &quot;Sad and Damned&quot;; the condemnation of sycophants in &quot;2 Cats&quot;; and her love/hate relationship with Christianity in &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Heaven.&quot; \nThis album could have reached the success level of Jane's Addiction, possibly, if the group hadn't disbanded right after the records release. Unfortunately, Nymphs has achieved a level of obscurity it never should have.
