Tannehill et al. (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997).pdf\n\nISBN 156032046X\n\nThis comprehensive text provides basic fundamentals of computational theory and computational methods. The book is divided into two parts. The first part covers material fundamental to the understanding and application of finite-difference methods. The second part illustrates the use of such methods in solving different types of complex problems encountered in fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The book is replete with worked examples and problems provided at the end of each chapter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a20e7ed7cc307bcdb1bdd936050585e5fa01ec","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+Mechanics+and+Heat+Transfer+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a20e7ed7cc307bcdb1bdd936050585e5fa01ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,162,14,126,215,204,48,123,205,177,189,217,54,5,5,133,229,250,1,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
