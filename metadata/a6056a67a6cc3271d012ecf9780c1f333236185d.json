The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name was in fact taken from the lyrics to Heavy LoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song Ã¢â‚¬ËœSinging SwordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœI loved the BattleroarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢).\n\nTheir first album Battleroar (2005) and their second album Age of Chaos (2006) were received very well in the metal underground. In 2008 the third album Ã¢â‚¬ËœTo Death and BeyondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was released and it received excellent reviews worldwide. Battleroar is also known for being a good live band and they have played all over Europe, including Spain, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and Germany.\n\nIn 2009 the band parted ways with guitar player Manolis Karazeris and vocalist Marco Concoreggi. They were temporarily replaced by Stelios Sovolos on guitar and John Papanikolaou (ex Innerwish) on vocals. This line-up played some shows in Holland and Greece.\nIn September 2010 the band announced that Antreas Sotiropoulos (Everdome, Wolfcry) is the permanent new guitar player.&quot;Blood Of Legends&quot; is the first BATTLEROAR album to feature SACRED STEEL vocalist Gerrit Mutz, who joined the group last year.\n\nThe song &quot;Poisoned Well&quot;, taken from &quot;Blood Of Legends&quot;, appears in the Greek fantasy feature film &quot;The Dragonphoenix Chronicles: Indomitable&quot;.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nAlex Papadiamantis Violin\n\nNick Papadopoulos Drums (2000-present)\nSee also: As I Suffer Silently, ex-Furor\n\nKostas &quot;H.K.&quot; Tzortzis Guitars (2000-present)\nSee also: Arpyian Horde\n\nAntreas Sotiropoulos Guitars (2010-present)\nSee also: Everdome, ex-Bloodshed, ex-Obduktion\n\nStavros Aivaliotis Bass (2011-present)\nSee also: ex-Bloodstained, ex-Angelo Perlepes' Mystery, ex-Fading Reality\n\nGerrit Mutz Vocals (2012-present)\nSee also: Angel of Damnation, Dawn of Winter, Sacred Steel, ex-Tragedy Divine, ex-Cemetery, ex-Variety of Arts, ex-Astral Door\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1.
