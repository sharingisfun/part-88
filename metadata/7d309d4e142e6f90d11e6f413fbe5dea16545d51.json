This book covers recent advances in energy harvesting using different transduction mechanisms; these include methods of performance enhancement using nonlinear effects, non-harmonic forms of excitation and non-resonant energy harvesting, fluidic energy harvesting, and advances in both low-power electronics as well as material science. The contributors include a brief literature review of prior research with each chapter for further reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d309d4e142e6f90d11e6f413fbe5dea16545d51","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Energy+Harvesting+Methods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d309d4e142e6f90d11e6f413fbe5dea16545d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,48,157,78,20,46,111,144,209,30,111,65,63,190,93,234,22,84,93,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
