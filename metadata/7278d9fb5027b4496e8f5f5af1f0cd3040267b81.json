EVP are commonly found in recordings with static, stray radio transmissions, and background noise. Recordings of EVP are often produced by increasing the gain (i.e. sensitivity) of the recording equipment.\n\nAs the Spiritualist religious movement became prominent in the 1840sÃ¢â‚¬â€œ1920s with a distinguishing belief that the spirits of the dead can be contacted by mediums, new technologies of the era including photography were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a spirit world. So popular were such ideas that Thomas Edison was asked in an interview with Scientific American to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and ouija boards mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose. As sound recording became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7278d9fb5027b4496e8f5f5af1f0cd3040267b81","amp;dn":"Dead+Speak+Pro+New+EVP+session","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7278d9fb5027b4496e8f5f5af1f0cd3040267b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,120,217,251,80,39,180,73,110,143,95,90,241,240,205,48,64,38,123,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
