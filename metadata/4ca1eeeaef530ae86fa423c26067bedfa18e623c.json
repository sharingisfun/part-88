It began during 1991 in Bergen, Norway and quickly became prominent within the early Norwegian black metal scene. During 1992 and 1993, Burzum recorded four albums; however, in 1994 Vikernes was convicted and imprisoned for the murder of guitarist ÃƒËœystein &quot;Euronymous&quot; Aarseth and the arson of several churches. While imprisoned, Vikernes recorded two studio albums in the dark ambient style, using only synthesized instruments.\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01. Sl Austan\n02. Rnar Munt Finna\n03. Slarrs\n04.
