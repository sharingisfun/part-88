On the verge of divorce, Aria's infantile and selfish parents are too preoccupied with their careers and extra-marital affairs to properly tend to any of Aria's needs. While her two older sisters are pampered, Aria is treated with cold indifference. Yet she yearns to love and to be loved. At school, Aria excels academically but is considered a misfit by everyone. She is misunderstood. Aria finds comfort in her cat - Dac and in her best friend - Angelica. Thrown out of both parents' homes, abandoned by all, even her best friend, Aria finally reaches the limit of what she can bear. She makes an unexpected decision in her life.\n\nSemi-autobiographical movie by Asia Argento about her unconventional/chaotic childhood with artist-parents in Rome (Italy).\nHer 9-years-old self is wonderfully played by Giulia Salerno and the difficult role of her ambivalent mother is masterfully performed by the great Charlotte Gainsbourg.\nAsia Argento: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Argento\nGiulia Salerno: https://kat.cr/confirm/url/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGxvY2luZS5mci9wZXJzb25uZS9maWNoZXBlcnNvbm5lLTQzMzQyOS9waG90b3MvZGV0YWlsLz9jbWVkaWFmaWxlPTIxMTExMzUw/\nCharlotte Gainsbourg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Gainsbourg\n\nAvantgardist Italian cinematography at its best!\n\nMore English info and links at Wikipedia article.\n\nOr see the German Wikipedia article and Discussions at unmedia24.net, SÃƒÂ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, or kameramann.de.\n\n674 x 572 is the original resolution on DVD after stripping the black bars left/right/top/bottom.\nDon't be fooled by the seemingly low bit rate. If you use the correct Codec/LAV Filter for h265/HEVC you will get the quality just as on the DVD. It's just the best there is and it works great for me with VLC-player as well as ZoomPlayer.\nSee HEVC.\n\nRipData:\nFormat: Matroska\nFormat version: Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size: 810 MiB\nDuration: 1h 41mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 111 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat: HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)\nCodec ID: V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC\nWidth: 674 pixels\nHeight: 578 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 5:3\nFrame rate mode: Constant\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nWriting library: x265 1.4:[Windows][GCC 4.9.0][64 bit]\n\nAudio\nFormat: AAC (Advanced Audio Codec)\nCodec ID: A_AAC\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode: Lossy\nTitle: Orig.
