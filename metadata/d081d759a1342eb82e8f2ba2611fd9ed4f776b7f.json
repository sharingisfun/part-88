It wasn't until bass\nguitarist Craig Adams and Guitarist Ben Gunn (real name Ben Matthews) joined that the very\nindividual sound of The Sisters of Mercy began to develop.\n\nBy late '83 / early '84 Ben Gunn left the band and is replaced by the ex Dead or Alive man\nWayne Hussey. This line up of Eldritch / Adams / Hussey / Marx released the seminal\n'First and Last and Always' LP.\n\nGary Marx leaves the band during the 'Tune In, Turn On, Burn Out...' tour, completing the UK\nleg and honouring an Old Grey Whistle Test performance. Eldritch, Adams and Hussey continue\nas a three piece taking the tour into Europe and then the States before climaxing with the recorded\nfor video release performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England, in June 1985\n\nHussey, Adams and Eldritch begin work on new songs in Hamburg. Eldritch rejects Wayne Hussey's\ninput. Hussey and Adams split to work on Wayne Hussey's material. They got a band together quickly\nand tried to trade off the Sisters' reputation with the name The Sisterhood. Eldritch acted quickly and\nreleased a record under the name of The Sisterhood; the brilliant 'Giving Ground' with James Ray of\nJames Ray and the Performance on vocal for contractual reasons. Hussey and Adams became\nThe Mission and Eldritch then released The Sisterhood LP to beat Hussey and Adams to the money\nowed to the next Sisters' project from RCA.\n\n1986 sees The Mission top all polls and a silent Andrew Eldritch. The Sisters of Mercy, it seems, are\nno more until the bombastic Jim Steinman produced 'This Corrosion' release and the sublime 'Floodland'\nLP, both from 1987 prove a Sisters of Mercy to be alive in all but band members; with Eldritch on vocals\nand possibly everything else. Ex Gun Club Patricia Morrison is brought in on bass but there have been\nexpressed doubts as to whether her contributions were kept or overdubbed with Eldritch's bass lines.\nThe credits on the LP include many regular Jim Steinman musical cohorts and so we have to consider\nthat this LP is not Eldritch alone delivering the sound.\n\n1990 Patricia leaves and Eldritch gathers ex Sique Sique Sputnik Tony James (bass) with ex All About\nEve Tim Brechno (guitar) plus Andreas Bruhn (guitar) to make a very rock sounding Sisters of Mercy.\nThey release 'Vision Thing' and they tour stadiums. Its the big time but not for long - first Tony James\nwill leave closely followed By Brechno and Bruhn. Eldritch continues with new guitarist Adam Pearson\nbut record company disagreements means no more records after the single 'Under the Gun' / 'Alice ('93)'.\nIn 1997 an end of contract LP 'Go Figure' by Eldritch under the name SSV is given to the record company\nwho decide not to release it.\nFrom 1993 to the present day (October 2014) The Sisters of Mercy have been a live band only.\n\nWith no bass guitar player Eldritch and Pearson are joined by second guitarist Chris Sheehan (1996 - 2005)\nand his temporary replacement Mark Varjak (1997 - 2000). In 2005 Sheehan is replaced by guitarist Chris\nCatalyst and in 2006 Pearson leaves to be replaced by Ben Christos, another guitar player.\n\nThis line up of Eldritch / Catalyst / Christos have been writing and touring playing small venues of sets that\nare maybe two thirds Sisters classics and one third unrecorded material and covers.\nThere may be no record on the horizon but the band and the fanbase are as unhealthily alive as ever.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: The Sisters Of Mercy\nAlbum: Floodland\nGenre: Electronic / Rock / Goth Rock / 80s\nSource: CD\nAlbum Release Year: 1987 [2013 Canadian Reissue]\nLabel: WEA / Merciful Release\nBarcode: 0 22924 22462 1\nCatalog No: CD 60762\nNumber of Tracks: 10\nTotal Duration: 01:00:43\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.3.1\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 934 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [Stereo]\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File ID Tags [FLAC]: VorbisComment\nAudio File ID Tags [MP3]: id3v2.3, id3v1\nIncluded Artwork: Front and back booklet plus inlay\nAdditional Files: Log, Cue, MD5, SFV, FFP, Txt, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 315 MB\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n01.
