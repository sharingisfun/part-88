This is more of the same. Uncomplicated mid tempo crossover thrash in a Municipal Waste kind of way.\n\nIdeal music for parties. Party music it is, but not the kind I would put on to sit back and listen to. No, the sort you have to experience live with quite a few beers. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHas the band improved compared to Ã¢â‚¬ËœGreen Machine Laser BeamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I hear many a reader ask. Yes, the band has improved. Although I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really put my finger on what exactly has improved. But it seems like there is more variation on this album and that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tiny bit more melodic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbcbcae615fc8fe52a7b060882935f4efe9683c2","amp;dn":"The+Prophecy23+-+Three+Albums+Pack++mp3++%282010-2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbcbcae615fc8fe52a7b060882935f4efe9683c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,203,202,230,21,252,143,229,42,123,6,8,130,147,95,78,254,150,131,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
