Again, things are slowly moving forwards, hence the recording is finished close to a year later.\n\n\n2003\n\nNovember:The infamous Audiopain/Mysticum 7&quot; split EP is released by Worship Him Records in 712 copies featuring Mysticum's &quot;Black Magic Mushrooms.\n\n\n2004\n\nMay: In cooperation with Mysticum, Planet Satan Revolution (PSR) gathers all the band's old material (except the &quot;In the Streams of Inferno&quot; album and most of the stuff from the &quot;Piss Off!!!&quot; promo). The intention behind this effort, is to release this legendary material on CD format for the first time, however, the old master tapes are gone. Consequently, a decision is made to remaster everything directly from the old cassette tapes and EPs. Considering the effort in question, the result is pretty awesome. This leads to the decision of entitling the new effort as &quot;Lost Masters of the Universe&quot;.\n\n\n2012\n\nThe band members come together to start the writing process for the long-awaited Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlanet SatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album &amp; sign with Peaceville Records for this title, plus fully remastered &amp; updated editions of both Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn the Streams of InfernoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ &amp; Ã¢â‚¬ËœLost Masters of the UniverseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nRecording Line-up:\n\n\n  - Dr. Best: Bass, Programming\n\n  - Prime Evil: Vocals, Guitars\n\n  - Cerastes: Vocals, Guitars\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n  1.
