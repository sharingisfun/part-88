A lethal virus, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gray DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, ravages the world. The only vaccine, Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmbrosiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is in such short supply, it is only available to those wealthy enough and deemed Ã¢â‚¬Å“vital to the social orderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. With no hope for a cure for the common people, riots occur worldwide and a number of terrorist organizations have formed. As a response, the United Nations has created The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). You assume the role of JC Denton, a nanotechnologically augmented UNATCO agent. After completing his training, JC gets slowly plunged into the world of augmentations, human misery, and conspiracies, determined to uncover the truth behind the real world order.\nDeus Ex is an unquestionable masterpiece of a game. With its excellent blending of genres (RPG and FPS), ambitious and multi-layered storyline, and highly interactive and expansive environments it is a &quot;living legend&quot; among gamers. The level of flexibility in character development allows you to follow your own style of gameplay. Stealth, combat, deception, hacking - whatever works, and there is no Ã¢â‚¬Å“bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ choice, only Ã¢â‚¬Å“your choiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Every new implant you install in your body and every skill you invest in counts (except for swimming!) and opens new possibilities. Find out for yourself why Deus Ex is on all those &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot; lists.\n\n\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther\nGenre:........................................rpg / fpp / sci-fi\nDownload size:...........................431 MB\nRelease date:.............................June 26, 2000\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English.\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Ion Storm Inc. / Square Enix\nGame modes:.............................single-player\nACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY\n\n\n\nBonus content included:\nManual\nSoundtrack\n2 HD wallpapers\nNewspaper handout\nReference card\nAvatar\n\n\nSystem Requirements\nMinimum system requirements:\nWindows XP or Windows Vista, 1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended), 256MB RAM (512 recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9, Mouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778313ec43bf58e77cb88d68b91f6d239ce777ef","amp;dn":"Deus+EX+Human+Revolution+GOTY+MulTi+5++PC+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778313ec43bf58e77cb88d68b91f6d239ce777ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,131,19,236,67,191,88,231,124,184,141,104,185,31,109,35,156,231,119,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
