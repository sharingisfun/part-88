Scientists such as Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger uncovered bizarre paradoxes in the early 20th century that seemed to destroy the fundamental assumptions of 'classical physics' - the basic laws we are taught in school. Notoriously difficult, quantum theory is nonetheless an amazing and inspiring intellectual adventure, explained here with patience, wit and clarity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fda2c18b9721443cddde8430e2566db09e794b","amp;dn":"Introducing+Quantum+Theory+epub+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fda2c18b9721443cddde8430e2566db09e794b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,253,162,193,139,151,33,68,60,221,222,132,48,226,86,109,176,158,121,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
