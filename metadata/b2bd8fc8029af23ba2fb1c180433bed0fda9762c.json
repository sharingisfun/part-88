After trying ready-made baking mixes and finding the results rubbery and tasteless, she pioneered gluten-free foods made entirely from natural ingredients--no xanthan or guar gums or other mystery chemical additives allowed. That led her to adapt many of her family's favorite recipes, including their beloved pizzas, pastas, and more, to this real food technique. In Against the Grain, Nancy finally shares 200 groundbreaking recipes for achieving airy, crisp breads, delicious baked goods, and gluten-free main dishes.\n     For any of these cookies, cakes, pies, sandwiches, and casseroles, you use only natural ingredients such as buckwheat flour, brown rice flour, and ripe fruits and vegetables. Whether you're making Potato Rosemary Bread, iced Red Velvet Cupcakes, Lemon-Thyme-Summer Squash Ravioli, or Rainbow Chard and Kalamata Olive Pizza, you'll be able to use ingredients already in your pantry or easily found at your local supermarket.\n     With ample information for gluten-free beginners and 100 colorful photographs, this book is a game changer for gluten-free households everywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2bd8fc8029af23ba2fb1c180433bed0fda9762c","amp;dn":"Against+the+Grain+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2bd8fc8029af23ba2fb1c180433bed0fda9762c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,189,143,200,2,154,242,59,162,251,28,24,4,51,190,208,253,169,118,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
