Backing Pres and Sweets are superb musicians like Oscar Peterson, Louie Bellson and Herb Ellis. Five extra tracks have been added to the contents of the original album, including three alternate takes and two tunes not included on the originally issued set.\n\nLester YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final years werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy. His poor health and alcoholism began to limit his talents and even his capacity to play. \n\nThe sessions included here were two of his last studio dates ever. After the second one, he would only enter the studio on two other occasions: the following day, on February 8, 1958, with Harry Edison again, and with Roy Eldridge added (the results of this session were included on the posthumous album LaughinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Keep from CryinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and a year later, on March 2, 1959, in Paris, France. \n\nLester would die one week later on March 15, 1959, at the age of 49. \n\nThe original album contained six tunes (tracks 1-6 of our CD), but more material was recorded on the two sessions, including two new tunes that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t issued on Going for Myself (a nice ballad medley and a nearly complete version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“PerdidoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and four alternate takes. To complement our set, we have added the two aforementioned new tunes, and three of the existing alternates.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
