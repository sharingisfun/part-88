Bang! You're Dead! (1966)\nOne of six travellers who catch the bus from Casablanca airport to Marrakesh is carrying $2 million to pay a powerful local man (Herbert Lom) to fix United Nations votes on behalf of an unnamed nation. But not even the powerful man knows which of them it is - and his background checks reveal that at least three of them aren't who they claim to be. As agents from other nations may be among them, he and his henchmen have to be very careful until the courier chooses to reveal himself - or herself...\n\nRECEPTION:-\nOur Man in Marrakesh opened in London on 5 May 1966, the same day as A Man Could Get Killed and the day before Modesty Blaise. This caused the critic in The Times to write a combined review titled &quot;Humorous variations on theme of the secret agent&quot;, where Our Man in Marrakesh is noted for having a similar story as A Man Could Get Killed, but lacking the former's wit. However, the film gets some credit for a literally colourful chase through Marrakesh's dyers' quarter.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 881 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x352\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.818:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 92 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7973edf4c4337a9dc52b421a508223c2f2feab","amp;dn":"Bang%21+Bang%21+You%27re+Dead%21+%281966%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Tony+Randall%2C+Senta+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7973edf4c4337a9dc52b421a508223c2f2feab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,121,115,237,244,196,51,122,157,197,43,66,26,80,130,35,194,242,254,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
