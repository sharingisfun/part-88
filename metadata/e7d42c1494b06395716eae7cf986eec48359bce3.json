With zero record label support, Boy Kicks Girl played hundreds of shows throughout the United States, released two albums and developed a large following of loyal diehard fans. In only four short years, Boy Kicks Girl managed to support such major label talent as Blink 182, Tsunami Bomb, The Ataris, New Found Glory and Dropkick Murphys among others.\nIn 1997, Boy Kicks Girl self-released their debut album Ã¢â‚¬Â¦or something like that. The album quickly earned BOY KICKS GIRL local recognition, and set the bar high for their follow up album. In 1998 they released Public Display of Aggression and demonstrated their ability to surpass all expectations with a gut punching 45 minute punk rock ode to heartbreak. With popular tracks as &quot;We Are The Now&quot;, &quot;Little Things&quot;, &quot;Denny's Girl&quot; and &quot;Antisocial Girl&quot;, the album quickly gained recognition throughout underground punk scenes. Both albums ranked consistently in the Top 10 local music sales charts, received national college radio rotation, as well as air play on San Francisco's LIVE 105 KITS-FM.\nBoy Kicks Girl was noted for their staunch Do It Yourself (DIY) ethics and local music scene support. Boy Kicks Girl consistently produced and promoted shows in the South Bay Area assisting numerous local and national touring bands with showcasing their music. This persistent mindset, dedication and enthusiasm won Boy Kicks Girl Metro Magazine's 2nd place award for the Best South Bay Area Local Band of 1999 and again in 2000.\nThanks for getting your punk on with Boy Kicks Girl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7d42c1494b06395716eae7cf986eec48359bce3","amp;dn":"Boy+Kicks+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7d42c1494b06395716eae7cf986eec48359bce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,212,44,20,148,176,99,149,113,110,174,124,249,134,238,196,131,89,188,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
