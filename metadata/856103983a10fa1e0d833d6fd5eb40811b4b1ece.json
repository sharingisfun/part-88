Using the simplest mathematics along with numerous numerical examples it accurately and rigorously covers physical and chemical equilibrium in depth and detail. It continues to cover the topics found in the first edition however numerous updates have been made including: Changes in naming and notation (the first edition used the traditional names for the Gibbs Free Energy and for Partial Molal Properties, this edition uses the more popular Gibbs Energy and Partial Molar Properties,) changes in symbols (the first edition used the Lewis-Randal fugacity rule and the popular symbol for the same quantity, this edition only uses the popular notation,) and new problems have been added to the text. Finally the second edition includes an appendix about the Bridgman table and its use","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856103983a10fa1e0d833d6fd5eb40811b4b1ece","amp;dn":"Physical+and+Chemical+Equilibrium+for+Chemical+Engineers+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856103983a10fa1e0d833d6fd5eb40811b4b1ece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,97,3,152,58,16,250,30,13,131,61,111,213,235,64,129,27,75,30,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
