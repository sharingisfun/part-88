This is the first part produced by the Sledgehammer Games studio, founded in 2009 by Glen Schofield and Michael Condrey (former employees of Visceral Games), who co-created Modern Warfare 3 previously. The production focuses on presenting a futuristic battlefield, where are used various gadgets. The soldiers are equipped with exoskeletons, so they become stronger, can jump greater distances, use a high-tech camouflage or climb the vertical walls of buildings. In addition, on the battlefield are used small flying drones, vehicles floating in the air (hoverbikes), as well as shelters set during the exchange of fire.\nThe action of production begins in the future, precisely in 2052. The private military corporation - Atlas Corporation, led by Jonathan Irons, wants to save humanity, trying to stand on its feet after the global attack on the army and infrastructure. The player takes the role of one of the soldiers, who uses in the fight high-tech devices, including mentioned exoskeleton. Our and other well-trained soldiersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ task is the restoration of order in the war world.\nThe game is based on the use of the possibilities of futuristic weaponry. Thanks this, our soldier cannot just run and shoot, but also can perform huge jumps, use the advanced camouflage and more. In addition, the game developers took care of flexibility during the mission Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can use different strategies during the fight. During the battles, you can shoot with pistols and rifles using ordinary ammunition, but they are also available energy weapons.\nAdvanced Warfare is the first part of the Call of Duty series, which was created for three years. As a result, the studio Sledgehammer Games could focus not only on creating engrossed game, but also takes care of graphic design much better than it was done in the previous parts. There were applied new face scan technology and animation - now the characters that appear in the game are much more natural","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14dfc28bdd9b47300dd746d49e259931be32e827","amp;dn":"Call.of.Duty.Advanced.Warfare.2014.Repack-R.G.Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14dfc28bdd9b47300dd746d49e259931be32e827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,223,194,139,221,155,71,48,13,215,70,212,158,37,153,49,190,50,232,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
