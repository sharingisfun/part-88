An FBI agent who\nhas seen better days, too talented to work within the rules. You could think that you 're in a classic thriller. A brutal murder in an alley and an investigation getting nowhere. You could think that you're in a classic fantasy tale. A cop nicknamed &quot;Ghost&quot; like something from a bad dream, an alcohol-soaked hallucination. You could. But that allows you to have confidence in Ghost and to think that with him, you can trust in what you believe, rather than what one see.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff057348db479fafacdf89f71b810f1cd77eb5c0","amp;dn":"Ghost+-+One+Shot+%282012%29+%28Scanlation%29+%28Vee%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff057348db479fafacdf89f71b810f1cd77eb5c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,5,115,72,219,71,159,175,172,223,137,247,27,129,15,28,215,126,181,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
