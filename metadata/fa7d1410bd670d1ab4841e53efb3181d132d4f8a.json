Her townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population has been decimated by soul-consuming demons, and souls are in short supply. Watching over her younger sister, Mellie, and scraping together food and money are all that matters. The two of them are a family. They gave up on their deadbeat mom a long time ago.\n\nWhen Nina discovers that Mellie is keeping a secret that threatens their very existence, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to protect her. Because in New Temperance, sins are prosecuted as crimes by the brutal Church and its army of black-robed exorcists. And MellieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sin has put her in serious trouble.\n\nTo keep them both alive, Nina will need to trust Finn, a fugitive with deep green eyes who has already saved her life once and who might just be an exorcist. But what kind of exorcist wears a hoodie?\n\nWanted by the Church and hunted by dark forces, Nina knows she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t survive on her own. She needs Finn and his group of rogue friends just as much as they need her.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Haunting, unsettling and eerily beautiful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Rachel Caine, author of the New York Times bestselling Morganville Vampires series\n\n&quot;Un-put-down-able.&quot;--Kirkus Reviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A hugely fun and entertaining read.&quot;--SLJ\n\n&quot;Vincent (the Soul Screamers series) carves out an intriguing niche in the post-apocalyptic landscape . . . plenty of reasons for readers to look forward to the next installment.&quot;--*PW\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Eerily reminiscent of Margaret AtwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The HandmaidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tale . . . fans of Divergent and The Hunger Games will love the complexity of the setting and characters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--VOYA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7d1410bd670d1ab4841e53efb3181d132d4f8a","amp;dn":"The+Stars+Never+Rise+-+Rachel+Vincent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7d1410bd670d1ab4841e53efb3181d132d4f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,125,20,16,189,103,13,26,180,132,30,83,239,179,24,29,19,45,79,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
