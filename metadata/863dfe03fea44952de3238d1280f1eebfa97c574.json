He wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. He now has a passenger in his brain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an ancient alien life-form called Tao, whose race crash-landed on Earth before the first fish crawled out of the oceans. Now split into two opposing factions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the peace-loving, but under-represented Prophus, and the savage, powerful Genjix Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the aliens have been in a state of civil war for centuries. Both sides are searching for a way off-planet, and the Genjix will sacrifice the entire human race, if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what it takes. Meanwhile, Roen is having to train to be the ultimate secret agent. Like thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to end up wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n* * *\n\nNominated for the Goodreads Choice Awards 2013 Finals for Best Science Fiction\n\nWinner of the Alex Award for the American Library Association's 2014 Youth Media Awards\n\n\n\nRead by Mikael Naramore\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863dfe03fea44952de3238d1280f1eebfa97c574","amp;dn":"Wesley+Chu+-+The+Lives+of+Tao+%28Tao+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863dfe03fea44952de3238d1280f1eebfa97c574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,61,254,3,254,164,73,82,222,50,56,209,40,15,30,235,250,151,197,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
