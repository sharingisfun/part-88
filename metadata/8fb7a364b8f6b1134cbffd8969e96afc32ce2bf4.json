Featuring the magical and enduring characters of Gwendolen and Christopher Chant, and many more, this collection brings the stories of the world of Chrestomanci together for the first time. Winner of numerous accolades including the Guardian Award, these stories have been loved by generations of childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and adults and Diana Wynne Jones was hailed by Neil Gaiman as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe best writer of magic there is.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nCharmed Life - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nCat doesn't mind living in the shadow of his sister, Gwendolen, the most promising young witch ever seen on Coven Street. But trouble starts brewing the moment the two orphans are summoned to live in Chrestomanci Castle. Frustrated that the witches of the castle refuse to acknowledge her talents, Gwendolen conjures up a scheme that could throw whole worlds out of whack.\n\nThe Lives of Christopher Chant - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nHis father and uncles are enchanters, his mother a powerful sorceress, yet nothing seems magical about Christopher Chant except his dreams. Night after night, he climbs through the formless Place Between and visits marvelous lands he calls the Almost Anywheres. Then Christopher discovers that he can bring real, solid things back from his dreams. Others begin to recognize the extent of his powers, and they issue an order that turns Christopher's life upside down: Go to Chrestomanci Castle to train to be the controller of all the world's magic.\n\nWitch Week - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nWhen the note, written in ordinary blue ballpoint, appears between two of the homework books Mr Crossley is marking, he is very upset. For this is Larwood House, a school for witch-orphans, where witchcraft is utterly forbidden. And yet, suddenly magic is breaking out all over the place - like measles!\n\nThe last thing anybody needs is a visit from the Divisional Inquisitor. If only Chrestomanci could come and sort out all the trouble!\n\nThe Magicians of Caprona - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nTonino is the only person in the famous Montana household who wasn't born with an instinct for creating spells, but he has other gifts. His ability to communicate with cats just might help defend the city of Caprona against a mysterious enchanter -- but only if Tonino can learn to cooperate with a girl from the hated Petrocchi family of spell-makers.\n\nIn this spirited tale of adventure, Tonino learns that sometimes a boy, a girl, and a cat can do more than all the magicians of Caprona combined.\n\nConrad's Fate - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nSomeone at Stallery Mansion is changing the world. At first, only small details, but the changes get bigger and bigger. It's up to Conrad, a twelve-year-old with terrible karma who's just joined the mansion's staff, to find out who is behind it.\n\nBut he's not the only one snooping around. His fellow servant-in-training, Christopher Chant, is charming, confident, and from another world, with a mission of his own -- rescuing his friend, lost in an alternate Stallery Mansion. Can they save the day before Conrad's awful fate catches up with them?\n\nThe Pinhoe Egg - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nCat Chant and Marianne Pinhoe have discovered something exciting--something truly precious, very strange, and valuable. An egg.\n\nAn egg that has been hidden away in an attic for who-knows-how-many years. An egg protected by some strong &quot;Don't Notice&quot; spells. An egg that Marianne gives to Cat, even though he lives at nearby Chrestomanci Castle. Chrestomanci himself, the strongest enchanter in the world, is sure to be interested in the egg--and interference from the Big Man is the last thing Marianne's family of secret rogue witches wants.\n\nBut how much longer can the Pinhoes keep their secrets? Gammer, the leaderof the clan, has gone mad, a powerfulbad luck spell is wreaking havoc, and there's an unexplained plague of frogs.Not to mention the mysterious barrierCat finds in the forest.\n\nMarianne and Cat may be the only two who can set things right. But first Marianne must accept her own powerful magic, and Cat must uncover the secrets behind the mystical Pinhoe Egg.\n\nMixed Magics - Diana Wynne Jones\n\nIN THE WORLDS OF CHRESTOMANCI, BEING ABLE TO USE MAGIC IS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE.\n\nBut ordinary people have rights too, and only the strength and special skills of a nine-lifed enchanter can possibly begin to control the exploits of the numerous witches and warlocks, sorcerers and necromancers out to make mischief.\n\nThe four stories in Mixed Magics all feature the enigmatic Chrestomanci, taller and more impossibly handsome than ever. With him are many old friends, as well as a number of new acquaintances, and a particularly devious enemy with an outrageously despicable plot!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb7a364b8f6b1134cbffd8969e96afc32ce2bf4","amp;dn":"The+Chrestomanci+Series+-+7+Book+Collection+-+Diana+Wynne+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb7a364b8f6b1134cbffd8969e96afc32ce2bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,183,163,100,184,246,177,19,76,191,253,137,105,233,106,252,50,206,43,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
