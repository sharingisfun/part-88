In mid-1990 Varg took a one-year break, which he spent playing in Old Funeral, and later in Satanel, which he formed with Abbath Doom Occulta of Immortal.\n\nIn 1991, when Satanel disbanded, Vikernes revived his project, changing the name to Burzum (which translates to &quot;darkness&quot; in J.R.R. Tolkien's Black Speech, which is spoken by orcs, uruk-hais and other creatures of Mordor). Handling all instruments and vocals by himself, he then proceeded to write and record albums at a frightening rate; five albums - the s/t through &quot;Filosofem&quot; - were recorded in the space of one year, even though most of them were released later. In addition to all that, he joined Mayhem on bass, as well.\n\nIn the wake of the notoriety surrounding the church burnings, and finally the murder of Mayhem's leader Euronymous in 1993, Vikernes faced a trial and was sentenced to 21 years in prison (and 10 years additional confinement, a system that has since been changed). Not allowed to have a guitar in his cell, and proclaiming all Rock/Metal-based music to be culturally alien and non-Aryan in origin, he chose to continue Burzum in a keyboard-based, Neoclassical/Pagan Ambient vein for the two albums that followed.\n\nVarg chose to end Burzum in late 2000, disappointed that fans were still connecting Burzum with Satanism, despite his allegiance to Paganism and pro-right politics.\n\nAccording to Varg, because Euronymous was too incompetent to release Burzum albums on Deathlike Silence Records, Varg decided to start his own label called Burznazg (which translates to &quot;Dark Ring&quot; in Tolkien's Dark Speech), that was later (in 1993) changed to Cymophane (Greek: &quot;Wave to appear&quot;, the name of a gem that is shaped like an eye) and do everything himself.\n\nInteresting anecdote: In October 2003, Varg had a weekend leave from jail, and escaped during that time - only to be caught back later the same day by the police. Rumors also began to circulate that a third ambient album was to be released, and that the plans were canceled after Varg's attempted escape. Varg has denied this.\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that Varg would be released from prison, on the condition that he would have to report to his parole officer for the period of a year. On May 24, 2009, he was officially released on probation.\n\nInteresting facts:\n\nAiwarikiaR (Eric Oliver Lancelot), the former Ulver drummer, was intended to be the drummer of Burzum during the short period that Varg was thinking about making live performances. Fenriz from Darkthrone and Hellhammer from Mayhem, were also auditioned - the latter was in fact announced as the band''s new drummer on flyers in the interim between s/t and Aske.\n\nAt one point, before the murder of Euronymous, Varg was thinking about signing to Earache Records to release his fourth album and Earache did want to try having a Black Metal act on their line-up. Though, Earache hesitated to sign him because of his highly racist views (and also the fact that at that time, Earache were a Death/Grindcore Metal label and not Black Metal) and Varg was arrested a year later.\n\nA compilation released by Misanthropy Records in 1998 called &quot;Presumed Guilty&quot; contains the Burzum song &quot;Et Hvitt Lys Over Skogen&quot;, which appears on &quot;Anthology.&quot;\n\nBurzum has no official logo, it simply is the name written in different fonts. The old writing is often considered as the logo, yet Varg did not intend it, but only took the font he thought to suit the best among all other font stickers he found in a store.\n\nAll albums from Burzum/Aske to Hlidskjalf were re-released in 2010 on Byelobog / Candlelight as jewel case CD w/ slipcase.\n\nVarg is currently busy doing some arrangements to a collection of his old songs to be released re-recorded by September 2011.File Name \tSize\n1992 Burzum/01- Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown.mp3 \t17.12 MB\n1992 Burzum/02- Ea, Lord Of The Deeps.mp3 \t11.18 MB\n1992 Burzum/03- Black Spell Of Destruction.mp3 \t12.95 MB\n1992 Burzum/04- Channeling The Power Of Souls Into A New God.mp3 \t7.91 MB\n1992 Burzum/05- War.mp3 \t5.74 MB\n1992 Burzum/06- The Crying Orc.mp3 \t2.19 MB\n1992 Burzum/07- A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit.mp3 \t21.01 MB\n1992 Burzum/08- My Journey To The Stars.mp3 \t18.71 MB\n1992 Burzum/09- Dungeons Of Darkness.mp3 \t11.08 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/01- Den Onde Kysten.mp3 \t5.36 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/02- Key To The Gate.mp3 \t12.02 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/03- En Ring Til Aa Herske.mp3 \t16.43 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/04- Lost Wisdom.mp3 \t10.61 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/05- Han Som Reiste.mp3 \t11.11 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/06- Naar Himmelen Klarner.mp3 \t8.80 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/07- Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn.mp3 \t22.01 MB\n1993 Det Som Engang Var/08- Svarte Troner.mp3 \t5.22 MB\n1994 Hvis Lyset Tar Oss/01- Det Som En Gang Var.mp3 \t33.06 MB\n1994 Hvis Lyset Tar Oss/02- Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.mp3 \t18.68 MB\n1994 Hvis Lyset Tar Oss/03- Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen.mp3 \t18.18 MB\n1994 Hvis Lyset Tar Oss/04- Tomhet.mp3 \t32.69 MB\n1996 Filosofem/01- Dunkelheit.mp3 \t16.22 MB\n1996 Filosofem/02- Jesus' Tod.mp3 \t19.81 MB\n1996 Filosofem/03- Erblicket Die Tochter Des Firmaments.mp3 \t18.06 MB\n1996 Filosofem/04- Gebrechlichkeit I.mp3 \t18.05 MB\n1996 Filosofem/05- Rundgang Um Die Transzendentale Saule Der Singularitat.mp3 \t57.65 MB\n1996 Filosofem/06- Gebrechlichkeit II.mp3 \t18.04 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/01- Daudi Baldrs.mp3 \t20.17 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/02- Hermodr A Helferd.mp3 \t6.16 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/03- Balferd Baldrs.mp3 \t13.94 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/04- I Heimr Heljar.mp3 \t4.68 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/05- Illa Tidandi.mp3 \t24.03 MB\n1997 Daudi Baldrs/06- Moti Ragnarokum.mp3 \t20.78 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/01- Tuistos Herz.mp3 \t14.25 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/02- Der Tod Wuotans.mp3 \t15.39 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/03- Ansuzgardaraiwo.mp3 \t10.25 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/04- Die Liebe Nerthus'.mp3 \t5.14 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/05- Frijos Einsames Trauern.mp3 \t14.32 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/06- EinfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hlungsvermÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gen.mp3 \t8.99 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/07- Frijos Goldene TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nen.mp3 \t6.06 MB\n1999 Hlidskjalf/08- Der Weinende Hadnur.mp3 \t2.90 MB\n2010 Belus/01- Leukes Renkespill (Introduksjon).mp3 \t1.27 MB\n2010 Belus/02- Belus' DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶d.mp3 \t14.63 MB\n2010 Belus/03- Glemselens Elv.mp3 \t27.25 MB\n2010 Belus/04- Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning.mp3 \t15.41 MB\n2010 Belus/05- Sverddans.mp3 \t5.65 MB\n2010 Belus/06- Keliohesten.mp3 \t13.18 MB\n2010 Belus/07- MorgenrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶de.mp3 \t20.38 MB\n2010 Belus/08- Belus' Tilbakekomst (Konklusjon).mp3 \t22.02 MB\n2011 Fallen/01- Fra Verdenstreet.mp3 \t2.39 MB\n2011 Fallen/02- Jeg Faller.mp3 \t17.91 MB\n2011 Fallen/03- Valen.mp3 \t21.43 MB\n2011 Fallen/04- Vanvidd.mp3 \t16.27 MB\n2011 Fallen/05- Enhver Til Sitt.mp3 \t14.37 MB\n2011 Fallen/06- Budstikken.mp3 \t23.29 MB\n2011 Fallen/07- Til Hel Og Tilbake Igjen.mp3 \t13.64 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d2896557d40ee575646150ca0c822d65e1d7cc4","amp;dn":"Burzum+-+Discography+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d2896557d40ee575646150ca0c822d65e1d7cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,40,150,85,125,64,238,87,86,70,21,12,160,200,34,214,94,29,124,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
