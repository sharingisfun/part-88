Art evokes thought that in turn generates emotions, as by the means of music, where emotions, emerging from their secret compartments, foregather thoughts. For the artist, abstract thinking that does not find its matrix in the emotional is worthless; to the artist the world of abstract ideas offers no nourishment. Whatever lies outside the pale of his experience is for him of no consequence.

As always, disengagement from the optical must end up inexorably in the blind alley of Nothingness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead8db1d6e4087ec411efac9b91c44ffa11412bb","amp;dn":"Modern+Art%2C+Sweet+or+Sour+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead8db1d6e4087ec411efac9b91c44ffa11412bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,216,219,29,110,64,135,236,65,30,250,201,185,28,68,255,161,20,18,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
