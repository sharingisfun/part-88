With an enormous choice of inorganic/organic building blocks, MOFs possess a wide range of surface area, pore size, and functionality and, thus, have been considered versatile materials for many potential applications. This book presents a broad collection of recent modeling studies in the field of MOFs toward potential engineering applications, such as gas storage/separation, carbon capture, catalysis, water purification, and drug delivery. The subject of this book renders it unique, for while the various topics on MOFs boast vast literature, there is not yet a single coherent collection for modeling endeavors. The book will appeal to scientists, engineers, and students in the multidisciplinary intersections of materials science, chemistry, and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd098ed1ab389ea17ee93b05a67ba0c34388c235","amp;dn":"Metal-Organic+Frameworks+-+Materials+Modeling+towards+Potential+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd098ed1ab389ea17ee93b05a67ba0c34388c235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,9,142,209,171,56,158,161,126,233,59,5,166,123,160,195,67,136,194,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
