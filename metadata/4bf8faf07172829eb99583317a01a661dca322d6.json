True, fans of only Booker T &amp; MG's will nit pick and have issues. These songs and the albums they came from represent yet another avenue of Soul / R&amp;B that had not previously existed. Enjoy it for what it was and is....creativity at its best that helped define an era. And is still worth listening to today![/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf8faf07172829eb99583317a01a661dca322d6","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Booker+T.+%26amp%3B+The+MG%27s+-+FLAC+%28Big+Papi%29+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf8faf07172829eb99583317a01a661dca322d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,248,250,240,113,114,130,158,185,149,131,49,122,1,166,97,220,163,34,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
