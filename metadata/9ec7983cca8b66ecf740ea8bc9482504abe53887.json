Even more than the choreographed carelessness of punk and the hyperbolic gestures of glam rock and the New Romantics, Morrisseys early bookish ineptitude, his celebration of the ordinary, and his subversive endorsement of celibacy, abstinence and rock 'n roll revolutionized the world of British pop. As a solo artist, too, he consistently adopts the outsiders perspective and dares us to confront uncomfortable subjects. In his brilliant book, Gavin Hopps examines the work of this compelling performer, whose intelligence, humour, suffering and awkwardness have fascinated audiences around the world for the last 25 years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec7983cca8b66ecf740ea8bc9482504abe53887","amp;dn":"+Gavin+Hopps%2C+Morrissey%3A+The+Pageant+of+his+Bleeding+Heart+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec7983cca8b66ecf740ea8bc9482504abe53887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,199,152,60,202,139,102,236,247,64,234,139,201,72,37,4,171,229,56,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
