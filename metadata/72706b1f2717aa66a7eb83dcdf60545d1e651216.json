As each series of QI is based around a letter of the alphabet, all episodes in the series had themes beginning with the letter &quot;g&quot;. Series G featured a total of 16 episodes, plus an extra two compilation episodes, making it the longest series yet, and was the first to be broadcast in its entirety on BBC One. \nNine new guests appeared in this series: Jack Dee, John Hodgman, Barry Humphries, Lee Mack, Graham Norton, Sue Perkins, Jan Ravens, David Tennant and Sandi Toksvig. Another significant first is that episode 2 featured four guests instead of the usual three (with regular Alan Davies also present).\n\n\nEpisodes:\n\n1. Gardens\n2. G-Animals\n3. Games\n4.
