Now, she's a cunning and fearless assassin thrust into assignment after dangerous assignment, using everything she has - nerve, resilience, strength, sex - to come out on top. Her only rule: Trust no one.\n\nAbby's latest assignment is in Colombia: Go undercover and snuff out a dangerous arms dealer active in the underground sex trade. But when Abby purposely blows her cover in a last-ditch attempt to free the helpless victims, deadly mercenary Kane Woodland is recruited as back-up. His mission: Get Abby out of that hellhole.\n\nThe last thing Kane expects is to feel a primal attraction for Abby. But when she convinces him to join her on her perilous mission, their newfound passion could put the lives of their whole team at risk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9075138f6ccd45a3dabe46bc04334c6a70ccdbfd","amp;dn":"Elle+Kennedy+-Midnight+Rescue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9075138f6ccd45a3dabe46bc04334c6a70ccdbfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,117,19,143,108,205,69,163,218,190,70,188,4,51,76,106,112,204,219,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
