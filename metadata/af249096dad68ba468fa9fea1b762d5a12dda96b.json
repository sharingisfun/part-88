Roses have a reputation for being finicky garden plants that require chemicals and fertilizers to stay healthy and disease free. Fortunately, recent breeding efforts have produced disease-resistant varieties that perform beautifully in all kinds of conditions. Peter E. Kukielski, former curator of the award-winning rose garden at the New York Botanical Garden, highlights 150 of these tough, new varieties, rating them for disease resistance, flowering, and fragrance. He also tells which perform best in each region and teaches simple cultivation techniques that will result in gorgeous, easy-care gardens filled with healthy roses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af249096dad68ba468fa9fea1b762d5a12dda96b","amp;dn":"Roses+Without+Chemicals%3A+150+Disease-Free+Varieties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af249096dad68ba468fa9fea1b762d5a12dda96b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,36,144,150,218,214,139,164,104,250,159,234,27,118,45,90,18,221,169,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
