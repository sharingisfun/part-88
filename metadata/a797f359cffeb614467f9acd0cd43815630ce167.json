At first, we were hesitant to work on this show because of what it was talking about, but after watching the whole series, we really liked it. So we just did this thing just for fun and all, and of course, universally playable on any device. Be sure to download and seed our torrents, do not hit and run. If you hit and run, you are being a dick. Stop being a dick (please). And also, if you do not like on how we do things around here, don't be a bitch and moan about it. We are not interested in hearing your complaints, unless otherwise they are reasonable. We only did this for fun, and we will do what we do, no exceptions. People are here to get what they want for free, but then sometimes people just want to just flame you or bring you down, knock you down. Sometimes, people are just idiots / annoying these days, don't be one of them thats all we're saying. Be thankful that there are people who are trying to provide everyone with the best releases. It ain't free to be getting all of these resources and other stuff that makes this group run. Thank you. Please take this into consideration the next time you are to leave a comment on any torrents, not just ours","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a797f359cffeb614467f9acd0cd43815630ce167","amp;dn":"%5BAnimeRG%5D+Steins%3BGate+COMPLETE+1-25+%2B+OVA+%5B1080p%5D+%5BSushiKushi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a797f359cffeb614467f9acd0cd43815630ce167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,151,243,89,207,254,182,20,70,127,154,205,12,212,56,21,99,12,225,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
