Humanity, in a desperate last act,\ncalls upon an unlikely defender - a convicted sinner, rejected\nby society and cast out of the light... a man known as Harkyn\nNow, alongside his mentor, Kaslo, they must travel to the source\nof the Darkness... to face the Lords of the Fallen.\nPlunge into a fast paced action RPG with a complex and satisfying\nmelee combat system where weapons, armor and skills directly\ninfluence the enemy's speed and attacks... if all else fails,\nlay waste to your foes using forbidden magic power\n\nInstructions\n\n-Burn or mount the image\n-Install the game\n-Copy the crack to your game dir\n-Enjoy\n\nNotes\n\n- The game is updated to the latest patch (1.6) and includes all DLCs,\n- To change language, follow instructions inside CPY.ini\n\nAnother one bites the dust.
