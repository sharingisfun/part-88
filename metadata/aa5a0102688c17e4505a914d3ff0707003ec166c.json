Vivekananda was a disciple of realized and awakened saint Sri Ramakrishna.\n\nThe text and images of this book comes from the website Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, and the book includes a cover, linked table of contents. The formatting has been changed for better reading in book format, meaning paragraph are indented and space is removed between paragraphs, as well as having justification and hyphenation. The single and double quotes have been converted to Ã¢â‚¬Å“smartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quotes, while trying to preserve the poor apostrophe. Many scanning artifacts have been removed, but I wouldn't be surprised if many remain.\n\nThese ebooks were originally release in 2013 as EPUB and MOBI versions only. I've improved the formats of the table of contents to handle long chapter names better.\n\nComplete Works of Swami Vivekananda\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nVolume I\n\nAddresses at The Parliament of Religions\nKarma-Yoga\nRaja-Yoga\nLectures and Discourses\n\n\nVolume II\n\nWork And Its Secret\nThe Powers of the Mind\nHints On Practical Spirituality\nBhakti Or Devotion\nJnana-Yoga\nPractical Vedanta and other lectures\nReports in American Newspapers\n\n\nVolume III\n\nLectures and Discourses\nBhakti-Yoga\nPara-Bhakti or Supreme Devotion\nLectures from Colombo to Almora\nReports in American Newspapers\nBuddhistic India\n\n\nVolume IV\n\nAddresses on Bhakti-Yoga\nLectures and Discourses\nWritings: Prose\nWritings: Poems\nTranslation: Prose\nTranslation: Poems\n\n\nVolume V\n\nEpistles - First Series\nInterviews\nNotes from Lectures and Discourses\nQuestions and Answers\nConversations and Dialogues\nSayings And Utterances\nWritings: Prose and Poems\n\n\nVolume VI\n\nLectures and Discourses\nNotes of Class Talks and Lectures\nWritings: Prose and Poems (Original and Translated)\nEpistles Ã¢â‚¬â€ Second Series\nConversations and Dialogues\n\n\nVolume VII\n\nConversations and Dialogues\nInspired talks\nTranslation of writings\nNotes of Class Talks and Lectures\nEpistles Ã¢â‚¬â€ Third Series\n\n\nVolume VIII\n\nLectures and Discourses\nWritings: Prose\nWritings: Poems\nNotes of Class Talks and Lectures\nSayings And Utterances\nEpistles Ã¢â‚¬â€ Fourth Series\n\n\nVolume IX\n\nLetters - Fifth Series\nLectures and Discourses\nNotes of Lectures and Classes\nWritings: Prose and Poems\nConversations and Interviews\nExcerpts from Sister Nivedita's Book\nSayings and Utterances\nNewspaper Reports\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560932.Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda_9_Vols&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560932.Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda_9_Vols&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5a0102688c17e4505a914d3ff0707003ec166c","amp;dn":"Complete+Works+of+Swami+Vivekandanda+%5Bepub%2Cmobi%2CPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5a0102688c17e4505a914d3ff0707003ec166c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,90,1,2,104,140,23,228,80,90,145,77,63,240,112,112,3,236,22,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
