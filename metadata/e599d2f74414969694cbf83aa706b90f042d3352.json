They are full of wildlife - and animals' and people's lives often cross as they adapt to these extremes. Michelle Dockery reveals a nation comprising a multitude of islands, each full of surprises and places where nature thrives. Each episode explores how life survives across these wildly diverse islands, dominated by forested mountains, volcanic forces and powerful seas, arctic winters and tropical, typhoon ravaged summers; and reveals the unusual and unexpected relationships between human characters and the wild.\n\nEpisode 2 of 3: The Southwest Islands\n\nIn the far south west of Japan, there is a chain of islands stretching towards the tropics - a place where all life is influenced by the power of the sea, and where volcanoes and typhoons are forces to be reckoned with. The journey begins at an island at the top of the chain and travels south, revealing unexpected stories of isolation, unique wildlife and unsolved mysteries.\n\n=====================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 335MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 700Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n=====================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e599d2f74414969694cbf83aa706b90f042d3352","amp;dn":"Japan%3A+Earth%27s+Enchanted+Islands+-+2.+The+Southwest+Islands+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e599d2f74414969694cbf83aa706b90f042d3352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,153,210,247,68,20,150,150,148,203,248,58,167,6,185,15,4,45,51,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
