After one night together, she cuts him open, leaves him to fate. Reborn in a bath of ice, Phineas tracks Jude from the back alleys of Denver across the Texas desert for a violent showdown that leaves them on the run to Mexico and the debauched playgrounds of CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite. Descend into a nightmare realm where every act of perversion finds willing disciples. Enter a world of brutal blood sport, murderous role play, existential snuff films. Lines between victim and accomplice blur past recognition only to be redrawn according to violent whim. The myth of Orpheus is deconstructed on a razorblade as Phineas and Jude chase each other through a hell of their own making.\n\nPHINEAS POE is equal parts noir romance, revenge fantasy, suicide pact, urban myth exploded, and nihilistic tragedy.\n\n\n---\n\n\nGreat noir read!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5ce37d8ee1c9fb361d1f18543a550ffeaaafa2d","amp;dn":"Will+Christopher+Baer+-+3+books+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5ce37d8ee1c9fb361d1f18543a550ffeaaafa2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,206,55,216,238,28,159,179,97,209,241,133,67,165,80,255,234,170,250,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
