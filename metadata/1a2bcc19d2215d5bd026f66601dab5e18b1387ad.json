Add a third--a live Rolling Stones album every three years. In what's essentially become a flourishing, if decidedly spotty subcatalog (the notable exception being the stellar Get Your Ya-Ya's Out, culled from the band's 1969 performance peak), 1982's Still Life is the band's fourth live collection and marks the beginning of a long stretch of laurel-resting. Though recorded in support of the band's Tattoo You album, eight of the scant 10 Stones tracks here are either hits from their early years or covers of favorite rock and R&amp;B chestnuts. Though they would go on to have an artistic comeback (or three), this collection sometimes finds them struggling against being their own tribute band. However, it is the Stones and one thing we can always guarantee is that a its a fun ride and well worth every note and guitar squeal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2bcc19d2215d5bd026f66601dab5e18b1387ad","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Still+Life+American+Concert+1981+82+%282014%29+SHM+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2bcc19d2215d5bd026f66601dab5e18b1387ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,43,204,25,210,33,93,91,208,38,246,102,1,218,181,225,139,19,135,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
