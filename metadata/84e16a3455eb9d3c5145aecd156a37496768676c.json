It helps readers see how origami intersects a variety of mathematical topics, from the more obvious realm of geometry to the fields of algebra, number theory, and combinatorics. With over 100 new pages, this updated and expanded edition now includes 30 activities and offers better solutions and teaching tips for all activities.\n\nThe book contains detailed plans for 30 hands-on, scalable origami activities. Each activity lists courses in which the activity might fit, includes handouts for classroom use, and provides notes for instructors on solutions, how the handouts can be used, and other pedagogical suggestions. The handouts are also available on the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CRC Press web page","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e16a3455eb9d3c5145aecd156a37496768676c","amp;dn":"Project+Origami%3A+Activities+for+Exploring+Mathematics%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84e16a3455eb9d3c5145aecd156a37496768676c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,225,106,52,85,235,157,60,81,69,174,205,21,106,55,73,103,104,103,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
