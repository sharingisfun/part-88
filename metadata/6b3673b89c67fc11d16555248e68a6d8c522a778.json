With both simpleand elaborate arrangements - not overdone - and perfect delivery, BethÃƒÂ¢nia's renditions take the listener on a musical journey through the new and the classic in Brazilian song. Her enunciation in &quot;ChÃƒÂ£o de Estrelas&quot; (&quot;Floor of Stars&quot;) is precise and poetic. It is a well-deserved tribute to song writers SÃƒÂ­lvio Caldas and Orestes Barbosa. Jaime AlÃƒÂ©m's guitar accompaniment brings out the simplicity and serenity in this classic Brazilian tune. Besides Adriana Calcanhoto, who wrote the title track, another newcomer to BethÃƒÂ¢nia's repertoire is Brazilian sensation Chico CÃƒÂ©sar. CÃƒÂ©sar's first composition featured in this release, &quot;Onde EstarÃƒÂ¡ o Meu Amor&quot; (&quot;Where Will My Love Be&quot;) is a melancholic song with a soft Brazilian countryside feeling. It is, however, in the other Chico CÃƒÂ©sar song, &quot;InvocaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o&quot; (&quot;Invocation&quot;), that BethÃƒÂ¢nia shows her extraordinary voice and interpretation. This haunting melody and poignant lyrics begin with the string section setting the mood for the invocation. There is darkness in the music and mysticism in the words. BethÃƒÂ¢nia sings &quot;InvocaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o&quot; almost like a prayer. VirgÃƒÂ­nia Rodrigues provides a ghost-like voice in the background, like a prisoner and slave crying. This chant contrasts dramatically with the drum and bass accompaniment.\nSwitching from this emotional setting, Chico Buarque joins Maria BethÃƒÂ¢nia in Ary Barroso and Luiz Peixoto's &quot;Quando Eu Penso na Bahia&quot; (&quot;When I Think of Bahia&quot;). The tone is very relaxed and fun. Having performed together in a CanecÃƒÂ£o show in the 70's in Rio de Janeiro, BethÃƒÂ¢nia and Buarque feel very at ease in each other's presence. However, BethÃƒÂ¢nia's homage to the Brazilian greats does not stop here. Vicente Paiva and Jayme Redondo's great exultation prayer &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;) is a peaceful and beautiful song praising Brazil. Like other well-known songs in that same vein, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; paints the colorful Brazilian landscape and the beautiful open skies in a very sensitive performance by BethÃƒÂ¢nia.\nCaetano Veloso's &quot;Eterno em Mim&quot; (Eternal in Me) is a statement for BethÃƒÂ¢nia's life. From the opening words, &quot;nÃƒÂ£o hÃƒÂ¡ nada no mundo que possa fazer eu deixar de cantar&quot; (there is nothing in the world that will keep me from singing), until BethÃƒÂ¢nia's last breath, she puts a lot of emotion in these lyrics. Her voice carries the weight of someone who truly believes and lives Veloso's lyrics.\nÃƒâ€šmbar is the celebration of Maria BethÃƒÂ¢nia's 50th birthday. As a mature artist, BethÃƒÂ¢nia continues to explore the new music of Brazil as she records Adriana Calcanhoto, Chico CÃƒÂ©sar, and Carlinhos Brown at the same time as she sings classics by SÃƒÂ­lvio Caldas, Orestes Barbosa, Ary Barroso, and Vicente Paiva. Ãƒâ€šmbar clearly shows the singer's dedication to her art. BethÃƒÂ¢nia's passion is stamped in every note and word she breathes. Ãƒâ€šmbar is exuberant and heartfelt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b3673b89c67fc11d16555248e68a6d8c522a778","amp;dn":"Maria+Beth%26acirc%3Bnia+-+Ambar+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b3673b89c67fc11d16555248e68a6d8c522a778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,54,115,184,156,103,252,17,209,101,85,36,142,104,166,216,197,34,167,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
