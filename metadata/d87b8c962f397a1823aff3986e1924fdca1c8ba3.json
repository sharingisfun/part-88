Mohlenkamp (2009).pdf\n\nIn these lecture notes, instruction on using Matlab is dispersed through the material on numerical methods. In these lectures details about how to use Matlab are detailed (but not verbose) and explicit. To teach programming, students are usually given examples of working programs and are asked to make modifications.\n\nThe lectures are designed to be used in a computer classroom, but could be used in a lecture format with students doing computer exercises afterward. The lectures are divided into four Parts with a summary provided at the end of each Part. Throughout the text Matlab commands are preceded by the symbol &gt;, which is the prompt in the command window. Programs are surrounded by a box","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87b8c962f397a1823aff3986e1924fdca1c8ba3","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Numerical+Methods+and+Matlab+Programming+for+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87b8c962f397a1823aff3986e1924fdca1c8ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,123,140,150,47,57,122,24,35,175,243,152,110,25,36,253,202,28,139,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
