Some are based on truth, while others on falsehood, but they remain intellectual differences whether or not someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belief is based on it. However, the subject of the finality of the prophethood of the Holy Prophet (sa) regarding which some Muslims disagree with the Ahmadiyya Muslim JamÃ„ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Ëœat has left the form of intellectual discussion and assumed the shape of mischief and falsehood. This is because a malicious allegation is made against the Ahmadiyya Muslim JamÃ„ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Ëœat that it considers Hazrat MirzÃ„ï¿½ GhulÃ„ï¿½m Ahmad QÃ„ï¿½diÃ„ï¿½nÃ„Â«as a Prophet in the sense that goes against the message of the following statements.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the Messenger of Allah and The Seal of the Prophets; and Allah has full knowledge of all things. O ye who believe, remember Allah with much remembrance; and glorify Him morning and evening.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Al-Ahzab CH. 33 V. 41-43).\n\nIn the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwhite paperÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ of the government of Pakistan, a most painful, vile and baseless allegation has been made against the Promised Messiah (peace be on him). It states that the Promised Messiah (peace be on him) God forbid repudiated the verse of the Holy Quran containing the words Ã¢â‚¬ËœKhatamun-NabbiyeenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hence did not believe in the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) as Ã¢â‚¬ËœKhatamun-NabbiyeenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - The Seal of the Prophets. The followers of the Promised Messiah (peace be on him), Jamaat Ahmadiyya, also carry the same view.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRelated torrent:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11963082&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11963082&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11931022&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11931022&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8005ee1b330cc05c9172ff760201de9f3a18fa79","amp;dn":"Finality+of+Prophethood+-+Khatame_Nabbuwat+-+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8005ee1b330cc05c9172ff760201de9f3a18fa79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,5,238,27,51,12,192,92,145,114,255,118,2,1,222,159,58,24,250,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
