Treating virtuoso organ playing as an extreme sport, Carpenter frequently delivers wildly inventive and exciting recitals that have made him a pop star, and such flights of fancy as Music for an Imaginary Film and his Song Paraphrases are explorations of his undeniably mad skills as a performer and as a composer of startling ingenuity and freshness. Carpenter's renditions of other composers' works are, at their core, faithful transcriptions, though they sometimes turn into outlandish improvisations that display his incredible dexterity and athleticism.\n\nFrom http://www.allmusic.com/album/if-you-could-read-my-mind-mw0002630950\n\n-------------\n\n\n1.
