This document was prepared jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy and EPRI to address this need. It represents a consensus perspective on 12 different configurations of biomass, geothermal, photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind technologies. It also provides data on battery storage systems for use in conjunction with renewable energy systems. In addition, various approaches to analyzing project financial attractiveness are presented. This document is designed for use by electric-utility and powerproject planners, energy policy analysts, and technology R&amp;D planners","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61006414b36de304ebd44c5fb51c58839388bb0","amp;dn":"Renewable+Energy+Technology+Characterizations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61006414b36de304ebd44c5fb51c58839388bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,16,6,65,75,54,222,48,78,189,68,197,251,81,197,136,57,56,139,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
