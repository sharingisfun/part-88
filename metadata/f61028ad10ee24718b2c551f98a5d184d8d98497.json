Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\n\nEpisode 210 &quot;The One with the Submarine&quot;: TACS is back live from the compound and Ant gets right into Gavin McInnesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drinking habits, the GOP debate, our fucked up country, the pros and cons of Trump, and grey areas. Anthony then breaks down the republican debate stage, Ben CarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“monologue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ period pride, hoaxes becoming reality, and gets into Ã¢â‚¬Å“drone chatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the flying he did over the weekend, his neighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abandoned clubhouse, drone rules, safety, and the future of drones. We hear about Frank GiffordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, talk about Kathie Lee, Rosie OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢DonnellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“rebelliousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ son, I Am Cait, Steve-OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest arrest, the one year anniversary of Mike BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, Ã¢â‚¬Å“peaceful marchesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Ferguson that included looting and shooting, a racist pig roast, a police submarine in the Hamptons, and Ant talks about what he wants in the NY studio, gives us some breaking news, and waxes on ashtrays and lighters being dÃƒÂ©cor. We learn that MSNBC was bamboozled, revisit the captainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s names from the Asiana Airlines crash, Ant takes a walk down remote control lane, we see unreasonable protesters fucking with Bernie Sanders, and find out Captain Kangaroo was a total freak.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61028ad10ee24718b2c551f98a5d184d8d98497","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-08-10+-+The+One+with+the+Submarine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61028ad10ee24718b2c551f98a5d184d8d98497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,16,40,173,16,238,36,113,139,44,85,31,152,165,209,132,216,217,132,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
