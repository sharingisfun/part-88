Brave the elements and other survivors, hunt for supplies, explore the world, uncover the mystery, answer the question: How far will you go to survive?\n\nDeep survival simulation gameplay where every decision matters. Explore a large open world in search of resources, and balance Conditions such as Hypothermia, Starvation, Dehydration, and a bevy of afflictions and injuries that can take you down, from Blood Loss to Dysentery.\n\nMorally challenging scenarios that push players to answer the question: Ã¢â‚¬Å“How far will you go to survive?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. Any survivor you meet in the world can be friend or foe. Will you risk your life to discover what they know and selflessly sacrifice for the common good, or liveÃ¢â‚¬â€and potentially dieÃ¢â‚¬â€by the adage, Ã¢â‚¬Å“might makes rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?\n\nExperience dozens of hours of free-form Survival Sandbox gameplay. Push yourself and your skill to survive as long as possible in a variety of survival scenarios, across a large open world. Balance your resources against the threats posed by mother nature, and by other AI survivors you meet along the way.\n\nRich episodic fiction featuring dozens of locations, a cast of memorable characters, and a mature post-disaster storyline inspired by the creative risk-taking seen in many of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exciting television series. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the end of the world, but you can see it from here.\n\n\nOfficial website:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://intothelongdark.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://intothelongdark.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGamesport preview of the game:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-long-dark-is-a-brutal-yet-beautiful-twist-on-t/1100-6421114/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-long-dark-is-a-brutal-yet-beautiful-twist-on-t/1100-6421114/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGame version: 1.27 (alpha)\n\nThis update is mostly focused on wolves and their behavior and spawning. \nThe full change list:\n\n* Reduced % chance of Fluffy spawning in the Dam. \n* Fluffy will no longer respawn in the Dam after X days. \n* Wolf population has been modified to reduce overall density. \n* Wolves will show more interest in the player and be &quot;drawn&quot; to them based on behaviour. \n* There is now a chance that a Wolf will Flee when it detects the player at a distance (vs. going straight into Stalking behaviour). \n* Fixed bug where Wolves would sometimes ignore lit Flares.
