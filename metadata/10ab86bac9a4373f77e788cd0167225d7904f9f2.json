In the film, Alabama couple Gabe Watson and his new bride, 26 year-old Tina Watson, married just 11 days, go on their dream honeymoon to scuba dive near Australia's Great Barrier Reef, where Tina drowns in what appears to be a freak accident. With authorities puzzled over Gabe's inconsistent statements about Tina's death, her father Tommy Thomas begins to suspect Gabe may have murdered his daughter. When an underwater photo of Tina lying motionless on the ocean floor emerges, Australian authorities begin to suspect foul play, charge Gabe with his wife's death and extradite him to their country, where he eventually pleads guilty to manslaughter and serves 18 months in prison. Alabama prosecutors, agreeing with Tommy's suspicion Tina was murdered and Gabe had possibly planned it before they left the state, decide to pursue murder charges in the United States. But, due to lack of evidence, the judge dismisses the case - causing many to wonder what a jury would've made of the evidence and leaving Tommy with more unanswered questions about what actually happened to his daughter on her honeymoon.              \n\nACTORS: \nBilly Miller, Amber Clayton, Gary Sweet, Harvey Keitel, Liz Alexander, Gael Ballantyne, \n\nRELEASED: \n 25 August 2012 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2276860/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2276860/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 845088496 bytes (805.94 MiB), duration: 01:33:57, avg.bitrate: 1199 kb/s\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x404, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=59991843194233070205.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=59991843194233070205.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=73569617769204273755.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=73569617769204273755.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=42231761220963155333.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=42231761220963155333.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : PFa\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ab86bac9a4373f77e788cd0167225d7904f9f2","amp;dn":"Fatal+Honeymoon+2012+BDRip+x264-PFa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ab86bac9a4373f77e788cd0167225d7904f9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,171,134,186,201,164,55,63,119,231,136,205,1,103,34,93,121,4,249,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
