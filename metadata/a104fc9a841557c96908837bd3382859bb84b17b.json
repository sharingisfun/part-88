The Talos Principle writers Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes have returned to pen the expansion and show players an entirely different side of Elohim's world through a journey to Gehenna filled with new characters and a new society with its own history and philosophy.\n\nSystem Requirements\nOS: Windows XP 32-bit (with service pack 3) \nProcessor: Dual-core 2.0 GHz \nMemory: 2 GB RAM \nGraphics: DirectX 10 class GPU with 512MB VRAM (nVidia GeForce 8600 series, AMD Radeon HD 3600 series, Intel HD 4000 series) \nDirectX: Version 9.0 \nHard Drive: 5 GB available space \nSound Card: DirectX9.0c Compatible Sound Card\n\nRECOMMENDED: \nOS: Windows 7 64-bit \nProcessor: Quad-core 3.0 GHz \nMemory: 4 GB RAM \nGraphics: DirectX 11 class GPU with 1GB VRAM (nVidia GeForce 480 GTX, AMD Radeon HD 5870) \nDirectX: Version 9.0 \nHard Drive: 8 GB available space \nSound Card: DirectX9.0c Compatible Sound Card","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a104fc9a841557c96908837bd3382859bb84b17b","amp;dn":"The.Talos.Principle.Road.To.Gehenna.DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a104fc9a841557c96908837bd3382859bb84b17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,4,252,154,132,21,87,201,105,8,131,123,211,56,40,89,187,132,177,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
