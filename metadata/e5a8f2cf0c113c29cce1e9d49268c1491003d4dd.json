In this book, different genomics and proteomics technologies and principles are examined. The fundamental knowledge presented in this book opens up an entirely new way of approaching DNA chip technology, DNA array assembly, gene expression analysis, assessing changes in genomic DNA, structure-based functional genomics, protein networks, and so on.\n\n\nTopics in the book include:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Different gene products with a similar role in neuronal defense against oxidative\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genetic epidemiology\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Elucidation of proto-oncogene c-abl function with the use of mouse models and the disease model of chronic myeloid leukemia\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Next-generation sequencing, microbiome evaluation, molecular microbiology, and their impact on human health","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a8f2cf0c113c29cce1e9d49268c1491003d4dd","amp;dn":"Genomics+and+Proteomics%3A+Principles%2C+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a8f2cf0c113c29cce1e9d49268c1491003d4dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,168,242,207,12,17,60,41,204,225,233,212,146,104,193,73,16,3,212,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
