(Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is I,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in other words, is the correct, if dowdy, response to Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) Some of us were even taught to diagram sentences; some had parents who corrected us at the family dinner table. (I can still hear my father pressing the subjunctive upon me. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I WERE,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d bellow, when I allowed as how thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be later curfews if I Ã¢â‚¬Å“wasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in charge.) Whether they retained the lessons or not, most people probably don't wax romantic about the grammar lessons or teachers of yore.\n\nWhich is why even those of you who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the soul of a second-grade grammar teacher will love Between You and Me, the hilarious and delightful Ã¢â‚¬Å“memoirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by the longtime New Yorker copy editor, Mary Norris, who confides in the subtitle that she is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“comma queen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The above is not a full sentence, I know -- but I think I can get away with it by calling it &quot;my style.&quot; Also, I put quotation marks around the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“memoir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I know youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re wondering -- because I was trying to make the point that your book is an unusual take on the form, dealing as it does with thats and whiches as well as with your Ohio adolescence as a foot-checker at the local pool.) Who knew grammar could be so much fun -- that silly marks of punctuation could be so wickedly anthropomorphized (a question mark is like a lazy person), that dashes grow in families (there are big dashes and little dashes and they can all live peaceably within one sentence), that there was once a serious movement to solve the he-or-she problem with the catchall Ã¢â‚¬Å“heeshÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Clearly, Norris knows: her book is plenty smart, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s its (oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a contraction, oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a possessive) joyful, generous style that makes it so winning. This is a celebration of language that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make anyone feel dumb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the perfect gift for the coworker you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to tell that Ã¢â‚¬Å“betweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a preposition that never, ever, takes an object that includes the pronoun Ã¢â‚¬Å“I.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sara Nelson\n\nReview\nMs. Norris, who has a dirty laugh that evokes late nights and Scotch, isÃ¢â‚¬Â¦like the worldly aunt who pulls you aside at Thanksgiving and whispers that it is all right to occasionally flout the rules. (Sarah Lyall - The New York Times)\n\nHilariousÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ [T]his book charmed my socks off. (Patricia OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Conner - New York Times Book Review)\n\n[P]ure porn for word nerds. (Allan Fallow - Washington Post)\n\nMary Norris has an enthusiasm for the proper use of language thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contagious. Her memoir is so engaging, in fact, that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to forget youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re learning things. (People)\n\nWonderfully confiding. (Miriam Krule - Slate)\n\n[A] winningly tender, funny reckoning with labor and language. (Megan O'Grady - Vogue)\n\nVery funny, lucid, and lively. (Julia Holmes - The New Republic)\n\nFunny and endearing. (Joanna Connors - Cleveland Plain Dealer)\n\nLaugh-out-loud funny and wise and compelling from beginning to end. (Steve Weinberg - Houston Chronicle)\n\nDown-to-earth memoir interwoven with idiosyncratic, often funny ruminations on the nuts and bolts of language. (Linda Lowenthal - Boston Globe)\n\nBetween You &amp; Me is smart and funny and soulful and effortlessly illuminating. (Ian Frazier)\n\nMary Norris brings a tough-minded, clear-eyed, fine-tuned wisdom to all the perplexities and traps and terrors of the English sentence. (Adam Gopnik)\n\nMary Norris is a grammar geek with a streak of mischief, and her book is obscenely fun.
