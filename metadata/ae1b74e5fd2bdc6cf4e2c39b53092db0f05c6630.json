But has the faceless vigilante's particular brand of harsh justice finally sent him off the deep end? Prowling the meanest streets of his native Chicago, the trench-coated Question thinks he also walks in another world, a strange shamanic space full of shadowy dangers. When Sage hears the voice of Superman's home city of Metropolis, he answers the call. Is he crazy? That's the question.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae1b74e5fd2bdc6cf4e2c39b53092db0f05c6630","amp;dn":"The+Question+%28001+-+006%29+%282005%29+%28Digital%29+%28Booster-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae1b74e5fd2bdc6cf4e2c39b53092db0f05c6630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,27,116,229,253,43,220,108,244,226,195,155,83,9,45,176,240,92,102,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
