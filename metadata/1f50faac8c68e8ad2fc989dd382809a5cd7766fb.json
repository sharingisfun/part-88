Pachyderm aficionado and teak-plantation maven Stanwyck wisely rules over both performing elephants and native workers in her jungle compound. But she is quickly interrupted by a handsome yet dubiously truthful stranger (Ryan) who is on the run from a local Burmese overlord and a dutiful British security official. A strange mix of Kipling-esque adventure tale, adult romance and circus movie, the film offers plenty of opportunities to admire the willing Stanwyck and Ryan far out of their comfort zones, tenderly kissing in silk pajamas at one moment, bemusedly watching an elephant perform tricks in another. Even on the lowest budget or the strangest fake-tropical stage, however, Alton performs his usual miracles with shadow and light, giving the film a colour-noir flair that's entirely his own.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 704x400, 25.000 fps, 1494 Kbps, 01h23m91s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles French, Greek, Spanish\n\ncover:\nhttp://postimg.org/image/84ef7vyrl/\n\nscreenshots:\nhttp://postimg.org/image/591c10url/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kghbldmm9/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/c9pbtswjl/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/gubi8qg8x/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f50faac8c68e8ad2fc989dd382809a5cd7766fb","amp;dn":"Escape+to+Burma+-+1955+%28Barbara+Stanwyck%2C+Robert+Ryan%29+multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f50faac8c68e8ad2fc989dd382809a5cd7766fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,80,250,172,140,104,232,173,47,201,137,221,56,40,9,165,205,119,102,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
