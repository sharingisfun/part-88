The player's objective is to destroy the enemy turrets and the &quot;Vain Crystal&quot; in the enemy team's base. If a crystal is destroyed, the team who destroyed the crystal wins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a8b6b75f1c5b95f013558a9b1686cae939a3a2","amp;dn":"Vainglory+v1.7.0+%5BAndroid%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a8b6b75f1c5b95f013558a9b1686cae939a3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,168,182,183,95,28,91,149,240,19,85,138,155,22,134,202,233,57,163,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
