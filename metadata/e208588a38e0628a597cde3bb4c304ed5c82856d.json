It previewed for the first time on Tuesday, May 16th, 2000 at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, England, and was subsequently staged at the Old Vic in London in September of that year.\n\nThe music for the production is based on Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin's Bolshoi Ballet version of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (1875), with additional music by composer Terry Davies. However, the story differs completely from the plot of the opera. Instead, it is loosely based on James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934), and the 1946 and 1981 films of the same name. The ballet is notable for its frank depictions of violence and sex, including homoeroticism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e208588a38e0628a597cde3bb4c304ed5c82856d","amp;dn":"Sky+Arts+Matthew+Bournes+The+Car+Man+HDTV+x264-pong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e208588a38e0628a597cde3bb4c304ed5c82856d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,8,88,138,56,224,98,138,89,124,222,59,180,195,4,237,92,130,133,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
