The film details a young man's (Kiefer Sutherland) \nsearch for his girlfriend (Sandra Bullock), who disappeared at a gas station \nafter the couple had a fight. Where the original film didn't reveal what \nhappened to the girlfriend until late into the movie, the 1992 version opens \nwith her kidnapper (Jeff Bridges) plotting his abduction. Over the course \nof the film, Sutherland's search for Bullock is intercut with footage of \nBridges that illustrates his mental illness and his repeated attempts to \nabduct women.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Kiefer Sutherland.\n=&gt;-Jeff Bridges.\n=&gt;-Sandra Bullock.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-George Sluizer.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Mystery : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1993.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.45 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 894 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 49mn.\n=&gt;-The Vanishing 1993.........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108473/\n=&gt;-The Vanishing 1993.........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042295-vanishing/\n=&gt;-The Vanishing 1993.........: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-vanishing-1993/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1777 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 205 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bcb66fbbc449cb5f96819707640b81f12bb9a06","amp;dn":"The+Vanishing+-+Kiefer+Sutherland+Mystery+1993+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bcb66fbbc449cb5f96819707640b81f12bb9a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,203,102,251,188,68,156,181,249,104,25,112,118,64,184,31,18,187,154,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
