Each release has been different, and with these differences it has allowed the band and the fans to grow. Enslaved takes on the topic of slavery, and when speaking to Max Cavalera about the new album he said he had wanted to do an album about slavery since his time in Sepultura. The inclusion of new musicians, which also includes his sons, makes Enslaved one album to show the diversity in an established band.\n\nResistance is a multilayered track which starts the album off to a great start and opens Enslaved like previous Soulfly albums, heavy riffs which then slowly introduce every member of the band. The track introduces the theme of the album and speaks about the first human reaction to slavery which is resistance. World Scum which is the first single off Enslaved could be mistaken for another band, as the inclusion Travis Ryan of Cattle Decapitation who provides the guttural backing vocals and the obvious influences of producer Zeuss makes the track feel a deathcore song. When I interviewed Max, he said that the current bands that he was listening to were of extreme metal and deathcore sound. In saying all of this World Scum is a fast paced impressive track and should not be overlooked for its influences.\n\nGladiator is a track which essentially Soulfly, chugging riffs, lyrics which are simple but would work perfectly in a live situation. Instead of SoulflyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usually tribal sound, it has a Roman style of music which suits the theme of the song and the chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“HAIL CEASARÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The song displays the different talents of the individual band members. Marc Rizzo  provides a guitar solo which would put many guitarist to shame, David Kinkade who has just joined the band is unrelenting with his drumming; not only carrying the song but making the song his own. Legions is fast; CavaleraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are what make the song, his unique vocals create a strong song. American Steel introduces the tribal sounds which have made Soulfly different to many others. One thing which I have found to bring the album down is at the end of many tracks there is an outro; for example at the end of Legions there is sound effects from a battle. It feels out of place on some tracks where on others like American Steel it suits it because it continues the sounds that were involved in the track.\n\nRedemption of Man by God contains duelling vocals of Cavalera and Dez Fafara (DevilDriver/Coal Chamber); and makes the song one which would pump many up. The layering creates a crazy yet impressive mix. The interlude in the song gives the album a break which I find as an issue as the song could have been much heavier. Not many things can be more metal than Max Cavalera screaming lyrics even if it is for a short period of time. Getting back to the theme of the album this song culminates it into a single song. Plata O Plomo is back to the groove metal sound which made Cavalera famous. The song is different as it has Tony Campos singing. The guitar work of Cavalera and Rizzo harness the groove metal sound and makes it a stand out track.\n\nRevengence is the best song on the album, no doubts about that. It ties it up perfectly. Sure the song structure changes constantly, but Cavalera took a chance on the song by including his sons. The added vocals of Richie and Igor create a beast of a sound. Another aspect of the song which is touching is Richie took parts of DanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings from his diary for lyrics and made the song more personal.  The drumming by Zyon is impressive. At times it felt like there are two drummers in the song. When speaking to Max about the song he was extremely happy of how the song had turned out and he wanted everyone to hear what was made. Just when you think the song stops, it just goes another level. The joint vocals create a force which is emotional as they are all singing about a fallen family member.\nFile Name \tSize\n2012 Enslaved/01- Resistance.mp3 \t3.51 MB\n2012 Enslaved/02- World Scum.mp3 \t9.82 MB\n2012 Enslaved/03- Intervention.mp3 \t7.25 MB\n2012 Enslaved/04- Gladiator.mp3 \t9.18 MB\n2012 Enslaved/05- Legions.mp3 \t7.96 MB\n2012 Enslaved/06- American Steel.mp3 \t7.82 MB\n2012 Enslaved/07- Redemption Of Man By God.mp3 \t9.70 MB\n2012 Enslaved/08- Treachery.mp3 \t10.71 MB\n2012 Enslaved/09- Plata O Plomo.mp3 \t8.99 MB\n2012 Enslaved/10- Chains.mp3 \t13.43 MB\n2012 Enslaved/11- Revengeance.mp3 \t10.51 MB\nEnjoy/seed/support RockBox!\nGenre:\tThrash\nSubgenre:\tGroove Metal\nBitrate:\t256 k\nSize:\t98.87 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc96d090a06b70e5f3ad216c25cd74912bb09966","amp;dn":"Soulfly+-+Enslaved+%28Special+Edition%29+mp3++2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc96d090a06b70e5f3ad216c25cd74912bb09966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,150,208,144,160,107,112,229,243,173,33,108,37,205,116,145,43,176,153,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
