Here, the police officer is narrator,\nguiding you through the shift and what happens within it, using his or her own\nwords.\n \n A four-time Emmy nominee, Cops offers a whole new perspective on law\nenforcement.\n\n\nREAD NFO:\n\nBecause it was aired in a 16:9 Aspect ratio on Spike (UK) as normal and it didnt look right, \nWe changed it to 4:3 aspect ratio and its the proper resolution now :)\n\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab86a2789b430ca0097e58bd0fbb24c05c142375","amp;dn":"Cops.S17E31.READNFO.PDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab86a2789b430ca0097e58bd0fbb24c05c142375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,134,162,120,155,67,12,160,9,126,88,189,15,187,36,192,92,20,35,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
