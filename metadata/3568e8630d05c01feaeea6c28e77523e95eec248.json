He is mortally ill and \nawaiting a heart transplant, while she hopes to become pregnant with \nhis child through artificial insemination. Cristina Peck, having matured \nsince her reckless past, is a beloved older sister to Claudia, a good \nwife to Michael and loving mother to two little girls. Her family \nradiates hope and joy. Much farther down the socioeconomic scale, \nex-con Jack Jordan and his wife Marianne struggle to provide for their \ntwo children while Jack reaffirms his commitment to religion. A tragic \naccident that claims several lives places these couples in each other's \norbit. In the aftermath, Paul confronts his own mortality, Cristina \ntakes action to come to terms with her present and perhaps her future, \nand Jack's faith is put to the test. If spiritual equilibrium is to be \nregained by any one of them, it could come at great cost to the others. \nYet the will to live, and the instinct to reach out to another person \nfor support, remains ever present among them all.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sean Penn.\n=&gt;-Benicio Del Toro.\n=&gt;-Naomi Watts.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Crime : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2003.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.56 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 795 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 04mn.\n=&gt;-21 Grams...................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/21_grams/\n=&gt;-21 Grams...................: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/21-grams-2003/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 678 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 204 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3568e8630d05c01feaeea6c28e77523e95eec248","amp;dn":"21+Grams+-+Sean+Penn+Crime+Thriller+2003+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3568e8630d05c01feaeea6c28e77523e95eec248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,104,232,99,13,5,192,31,234,238,166,194,142,119,82,62,149,238,194,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
