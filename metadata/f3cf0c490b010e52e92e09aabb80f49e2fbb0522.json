Photoshop, photo editor most used and famous, is undergoing very important changes to your users with the adoption of a new system of purchase and use, the Creative Cloud. Now, you pay per month for using Adobe software in more affordable plans. You can pay for just a software or more, and suffer the price change for each type of account. They all have direct access to the network Behance Network, a dissemination artistic portal aimed mainly at designers. Even after the last update, Photoshop remains quite like the CS6 version, and few resources were drastically changed or added. See, for example, this video came out with CS6 and shows some changes that are still present, as the options of the cutting tool and the new timeline, with transition effects and the possibility of adding soundtrack:\n\nCrop tool\nCan not imagine many changes in the intelligent cutting tool, the &quot;Crop&quot;, does not it? But Adobe even innovated where it could not wait and brought improvements to this function from the CS6 version, with some minor changes in later versions, such as the CC 2014.\nNow the &quot;Crop&quot; is much more intuitive, especially when it comes to adjust the tilt of the image. Instead you need to move the grid and then see the result, the picture is tilted when you turn over and you can see the result immediately.\n\nContent-Aware Move and Vibration Reduction\nWell keep the name &quot;Content-Aware Move - it can be of great help to you with this brush you can move objects and place the full background software automatically, without the need to use the tool&quot; Clone &quot;thoroughly.\nOf course, these adjustments are limited and that the action will not create a new landscape, but for small movements, as shown in the video above, you can fully gain valuable time with the help of this tool.\nA unique feature of the new version of Photoshop CC, is the intelligent reduction blurred caused by vibration in the camera during shooting. This filter scans stabilize the image and get good results in less severe cases and have good lighting. See the video below with a usage example:\n\nOther enhancements\nWho takes photographs professionally is well acquainted with the RAW extent, a kind of &quot;digital negative,&quot; an image file &quot;raw&quot; that needs to be edited later. Usually, photographers treat this kind of photo in Adobe Lightroom, but the new Photoshop brings quite incredible options for this format.\nAnother thing that has changed is the video editing, which won a timeline entitled to an audio track. Add fade transition effects and mount your videos without even using other software. The idea is to unify the Adobe basic services, so you only need to open another program if it is really necessary.\nAlthough not a 3D model building software, Photoshop CC 2014 won simple options for those wishing to use it in conjunction with other programs to make the impression of three-dimensional models. This greatly facilitates the lives of those who want to ride your 3D objects from images edited in Photoshop itself.\nThe software window has not changed much, only a few buttons have been added, making the user experience is not impaired. Anyone who has used the software before will not feel a great visual impact, but can take advantage of all the improvements the new version of the most famous market image editor.\n\nMain Features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Innovative tools accelerate the work of handling and allow incredible feats\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Customizable Interface\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Huge amount of keyboard shortcuts\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ remodeled Appearance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Several user-friendly filters\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New Content-Aware tools type\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fully in Portuguese in version 2014\n\nName: Adobe Photoshop CC 2014\nVersion: 2014 15.2.2 - x64 &amp; x86\nSize: 1.74 GB\nPlatform: Windows\nPortuguese Language\nFile Format: EXE (executable Menu)\nActivation Mode: Auto Crack\n\nInstallation:\nTURN OFF YOUR INTERNET\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 2 -.
