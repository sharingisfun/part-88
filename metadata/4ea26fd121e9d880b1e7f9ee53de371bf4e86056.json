Commissioned to create music for video installations in MoscowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Museum of Jewish History, Zorn has responded with a poignant Jewish-tinged score performed here by the virtuosic Israeli pianist Omri Mor. Also included is Rob BurgerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful solo piano performance of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landmark composition Beyond the Infinite (from The Goddess) and four rare film cues improvised by Zorn himself for Marc LevinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s documentary Schmatta. An intimate and varied collection of music for solo piano. \n\nPersonnel:\nRob Burger: Piano\nJohn Zorn: Piano\nOmri Mor: Piano \n\n    &quot;The End of Tradition&quot; \n    &quot;The Oath&quot; \n    &quot;Modernity&quot;\n    &quot;Island/Ghetto&quot;\n    &quot;New Choices&quot; \n    &quot;Revolution&quot;\n    &quot;New Currents&quot; \n    &quot;Loss&quot; \n    &quot;Hopes and Dreams&quot; \n    &quot;The Bund&quot; \n    &quot;City of Slaughter&quot; \n    &quot;Anti-Semitism/Pogrom&quot; \n    &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot; \n    &quot;Requiem&quot; \n    &quot;Schmatta&quot; \n    &quot;Pins and Needles&quot; \n    &quot;Collapse&quot; \n    &quot;Hanging by a Thread&quot; \n    &quot;Beyond the Infinite&quot; \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea26fd121e9d880b1e7f9ee53de371bf4e86056","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+25+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea26fd121e9d880b1e7f9ee53de371bf4e86056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,162,111,209,33,233,216,128,177,231,249,238,83,222,55,27,244,232,96,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
