Reba, Douglas R. Shier\n\nOverview: A Classroom-Tested, Alternative Approach to Teaching Math for Liberal Arts\n\nPuzzles, Paradoxes, and Problem Solving: An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking uses puzzles and paradoxes to introduce basic principles of mathematical thought. The text is designed for students in liberal arts mathematics courses. Decision-making situations that progress from recreational problems to important contemporary applications develop the critical-thinking skills of non-science and non-technical majors.\n\nThe logical underpinnings of this textbook were developed and refined throughout many years of classroom feedback and in response to commentary from presentations at national conferences. The textÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five units focus on graphs, logic, probability, voting, and cryptography. The authors also cover related areas, such as operations research, game theory, number theory, combinatorics, statistics, and circuit design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22b9ff39b476dd746794b64c84a22c8555627a4","amp;dn":"Puzzles%2C+Paradoxes%2C+and+Problem+Solving%3A+An+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22b9ff39b476dd746794b64c84a22c8555627a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,43,159,243,155,71,109,215,70,121,75,100,200,74,34,200,85,86,39,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
