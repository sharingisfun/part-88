The DVD stereo tracks and the audio CD are \nidentical in both issues.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nYou can tell if you have a good or a bad disc by looking at the DVD label or by listening to it.\n\nBad DVD:\nNo line underscoring the text on the DVD label (see the included images).\nAudio glitches at 2:33, 2:49 and 3:03 on the DTS and Dolby surround tracks.\nThe track is silent after Ian has sung the final Ã¢â‚¬Å“thick as a brickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the end of the album.\n\nGood DVD:\nLine underscoring the text on the label.\nNo audio glitches at the mentioned times.\nThree seconds after the final Ã¢â‚¬Å“thick as a brickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ian quietly mutters Ã¢â‚¬Å“YeahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ before the track ends.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\nWhen this special edition was released it was infamously affected by audio glitches which warranted a reprint. It had also gone through a \nheavy-handed mastering which made particularly the cymbals directly painful to hear at higher volumes. In my opinion the undoing of the \nmastering is prime reason why you should get this update.\n\nThe reprint corrected those problems, but unfortunately not all buyers had their discs replaced and shipped copies were not recalled. With no \nway of telling if a case contains a good or bad DVD finding a good one still proves to be pretty much a search in the dark, which is why I \ndecided to upload this.\n\nIf Warner Music ever makes it possible for fans to acquire the fixed disc I will remove this torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8dbb200ebe94d1b8d47e0cd278fdb0891391afd","amp;dn":"Thick+As+a+Brick+40th+Anniversary+Special+Edition+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8dbb200ebe94d1b8d47e0cd278fdb0891391afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,219,178,0,235,233,77,27,141,71,224,205,39,143,219,8,145,57,26,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
