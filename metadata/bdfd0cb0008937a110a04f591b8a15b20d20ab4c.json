It is a tale of a plucky bunch of moderately terrible people trying to escape from a lifetime of cheerful denial. Set in a drug-fuelled, retro-futuristic city in an alternative 1960s England, players will have to blend in with its other inhabitants, who don't take kindly to people who don't abide by their not-so-normal rules.\n\nGame Features:\nSuspicion and Joy\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We Happy FewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a survival roguelike, where you must learn to hide in plain sight among the Joy-happy citizens of Wellington Wells. If you act out of turn, or they notice youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not on Joy, the locals will become suspicious and will rapidly turn your frown upside down! Forcefully. You will need to practice conformity, stealth and combat if you want to survive long enough to escape.\n1960s England\nSet in a retrofuturistic 1964s, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears to be happy in Wellington Wells, including the roads, the people, and its omnipresent television personality, Uncle Jack! However, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a world on the brink of collapse. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover the history of this world, and how it came to be just so beguilingly happy.\nA Mature Story\nOur playable characters are not typical video game heroes - they are flawed and not particularly heroic, warped by the trauma their world has been through. Each character has its own storyline, reacting to the events of the world around them, and their place within it. Our stories are definitely not appropriate for children, but are laced with dark humour, hope, and even a spot of redemption.\nHighly Replayable\nIf you die in Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Happy FewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there is no reloading your save. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designed to be replayed. Each time you die, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll restart in a brand new city, thanks to our procedural generation tech. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to customize the world to your liking, and play through using multiple characters and playstyles. Each time, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn a little more about how to survive in Wellington Wells.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nMinimum system\nOS: Windows 7\nCPU: Triple-core Intel or AMD, 2.0 GHz or faster\nRAM: 4GB RAM\nVIDEO: NVIDIA GeForce 280 GTX or AMD Radeon 6750 HD series or higher\nHDD: 8GB Available Space\n\nRecommended system\nOS: Windows 10\nCPU: Quad-core Intel or AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster\nRAM: 8GB RAM\nVIDEO: NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series or higher\nHDD: 8GB Available Space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfd0cb0008937a110a04f591b8a15b20d20ab4c","amp;dn":"We.Happy.Few.Pre-Alpha.Build.11164","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfd0cb0008937a110a04f591b8a15b20d20ab4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,253,12,176,0,137,55,161,16,160,79,89,27,138,21,178,13,32,171,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
