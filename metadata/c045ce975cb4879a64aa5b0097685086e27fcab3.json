Meg yearns for the kind of passion that exists only in booksÃ¢â‚¬â€œuntil a violent storm lands her on the high seas with the most dangerous and seductive man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever encountered... or imagined.\n\nFor Cosimo, women are objects, to be manipulated for business or pleasure... sometimes both. But when the seafaring assassin accidentally kidnaps Meg on his latest mission, he must reconsider his position. Recruiting his unsuspecting captive for the danger ahead is far more challenging than he expectedÃ¢â‚¬â€œand far more seductive.\n\nNumber of pages: 464\n\nISBN13: 9780553587562\n\nISBN10: 0553587560\n\nFormat: EPUB &amp; MOBI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c045ce975cb4879a64aa5b0097685086e27fcab3","amp;dn":"Almost+a+Lady+%28Almost+%233%29+by+Jane+Feather+%5BEPUB+%2B+MOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c045ce975cb4879a64aa5b0097685086e27fcab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,69,206,151,92,180,135,154,100,170,91,0,151,104,80,134,226,127,202,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
