'Revenge of the Mummy' is perfect for a tomb raiding after Basil and Stephen find a Ancient Egyptian burial chamber underneath the flat and soon the mummy comes after them. 'Basil's Millions' is perfect when Basil stands to earn 21 gazillion dollars - but also evil Cousin Mortimer also stands to earn the same amount only if the two can get along with each other for 48 hours in the flat without arguments or fights. Perfect for any fan of comedy and children.\n\nMy Rip enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc07ba834790c0c8eaa35b10b2309f4750a2f5fb","amp;dn":"+Basil+Brush%3A+Sports+Spectacular+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc07ba834790c0c8eaa35b10b2309f4750a2f5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,7,186,131,71,144,192,200,234,163,91,16,178,48,159,71,80,162,245,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
