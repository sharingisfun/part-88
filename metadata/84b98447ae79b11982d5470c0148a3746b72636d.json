Whether this is offering other people something to laugh at or helping an elderly person cross the road, through these altruistic acts comes a sense of achievement, and from achievement comes self-esteem and a belief in oneself.\n\nEdward de Bono's new groundbreaking book offers an entirely positive way of life: with the emphasis not on sins that are to be avoided, but on things that are to be done.\n\n'H' stands for:\n\n- Happiness\n\n- Help\n\n- Hope\n\n- Health\n\n- and, most importantly, Humour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b98447ae79b11982d5470c0148a3746b72636d","amp;dn":"Edward+De+Bono+-+H%2B+%28Plus%29+A+New+Religion%3F+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b98447ae79b11982d5470c0148a3746b72636d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,185,132,71,174,121,177,25,130,213,71,12,1,72,163,116,107,114,99,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
