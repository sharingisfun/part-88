Meanwhile, a dangerous gang leader named Crazy Kung (Kirk Wong) is being transported as a captive in the same hospital. Crazy Kung escapes and attempts to take one of the twins hostage. In the ensuing chaos, the twins are permanently separated. One of them, named Ma Yau, is raised by his parents and grows up to be a concert pianist and conductor. The other, named Wan Ma, is raised by a woman named Tsui (Mabel Cheung), and grows up to be a street racer and martial artist. Neither of them has ever thought that he has a twin brother.\n\n26 years later, the twins' (Jackie Chan) lives intersect in Hong Kong. Wan Ma and his best friend Tarzan (Teddy Robin) get mixed up with a dangerous gang. Meanwhile, Ma Yau prepares to conduct a major concert. The twins accidentally switch places, causing confusion for both of them until they discover each other. The twins also have romantic interests named Barbara (Maggie Cheung) and Tong Sum (Nina Li Chi).\n\nEventually, the twins defeat the gang that has been threatening them, and marry their romantic interests.\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nName:Twin Dragons (Uncut) (1992) [Mux 1080p - H264 - Aac].mkv \nFormat:Matroska\nVideo Codec:H.264\nFile Size:25,001,280,538 bytes (23843.079126 MiB)\nRuntime:01:50:37 (6636.958228 s) \nBit rate:29975.360286 kbps \nWidth:1920 pixels \nHeight:1080 pixels\nFps:24 Fps\nDisplay aspect ratio:16:9\nAudio language:Ita\nBit rate:16-bit\nChannels:2\nSampling rate:48000 Hz\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105399/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105399/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ff6c47a065de34c824fcc4ecb966e269fd071e","amp;dn":"Twin+Dragons+%28Uncut%29+%281992%29+%5BIta+Mux+-+1080p+-+H264+-+Aac%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ff6c47a065de34c824fcc4ecb966e269fd071e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,255,108,71,160,101,222,52,200,36,252,196,236,185,102,226,105,253,7,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
