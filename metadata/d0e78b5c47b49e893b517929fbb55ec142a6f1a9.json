But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to HowlÃ¢â‚¬â€and herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€than first meets the eye","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0e78b5c47b49e893b517929fbb55ec142a6f1a9","amp;dn":"Howl%27s+Moving+Castle+-+Diana+Wynne+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0e78b5c47b49e893b517929fbb55ec142a6f1a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,231,139,92,71,180,158,137,59,81,121,41,251,181,94,193,66,166,241,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
