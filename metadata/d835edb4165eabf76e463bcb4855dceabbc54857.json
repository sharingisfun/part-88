VINE VOICE&quot;]\n\nPink Floyd is one of my all time favorite bands, watching their concerts on a television screen is an exhilarating experience but this album is a whole new animal. I simply adore when my favorite artists do symphonic albums, few others that are good at this are Metallica and Jean Michel Jarre, now if only Juno Reactor could do a symphonic album I would pass out from joy.\n\nAll the songs on this album translate beautifully into symphonic music, who knew that they sound like perfect movie scores from movies I wish could exist, I can almost picture made up scenes happening. Someone doesn't have to be a fan of Pink Floyd or even worry if they would like it to really enjoy this album. If I could get into a space ship and travel to deep space I would have this as my soundtrack, it's just an incredible mÃƒÂ©lange of sounds, one can hear colored dust and clouds, sparkles and rich harmonies - it's simply magical.\n\nFew of my favorite tracks (but oh they are all so good! )\n\nTime - time travel captured in musical notes, relaxing and fantastic. One minute its dusty deserts and next I feel like I'm floating in outer space, totally mesmerizing.\n\nComfortably Numb - I get goosebumps from the neck down to my toes when this starts. The flutes and French horns in this are stunning, and as a flute player it touches me, almost as if a thin silver needle poked my heart. This is so elegant and sparkling at the same time, its music one can seriously fall in love with. The violins and trumpets give it depth, it almost sounds like an ocean waking up to fresh sun rays peaking out over the horizon.\n\nNobody Home - sounds like a sunrise in a Hollywood movie.\n\nBreathe in the Air - reminds me of music from Spirited Away, one of my favorite anime movies, totally fantasy dripping into hears like honey.\n\nUs and them - beautiful finish to this artistic creation, at times it reminded me of a mixture of a soundtrack from a Hitchcock movie and the unicorn film, Legend - but still had its own uniqueness, very bold and mysterious at the same time.\n\nWhenever I sit down at night to sketch and draw I put on certain music that puts me in a specific mood, this album really gets my creative juices flowing, it rarely gets any time off from being played.\n\n- Kasia S.[/quote]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/22/Folder.md.jpg[/img]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra - Us and Them: Symphonic Pink Floyd (Point 446 623)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: London Philharmonic Orchestra\nAlbum................: Us and Them: Symphonic Pink Floyd (Point 446 623)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1995\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 245kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
