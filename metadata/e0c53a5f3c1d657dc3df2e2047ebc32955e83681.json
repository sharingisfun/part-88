As with previous editions of the book, the authors introduce key web authoring techniques with a strong focus on industry application. New coverage includes developing for touchscreen and mobile devices, and using the jQuery library. A real-world project, similar to what students would encounter in a professional setting, is developed chapter by chapter. Because professional web development jobs often require programmers to add features to existing sites, each chapter project uses a professionally designed web site. After completing a course using this textbook, students will be able to use JavaScript to build professional quality, dynamic web sites.\n\n\nPaperback: 928 pages\nPublisher: Course Technology; 6 edition (August 27, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1305078446\nISBN-13: 978-1305078444","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c53a5f3c1d657dc3df2e2047ebc32955e83681","amp;dn":"JavaScript%3A+The+Web+Warrior+Series+6th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c53a5f3c1d657dc3df2e2047ebc32955e83681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,197,58,95,60,29,101,125,195,223,46,32,71,235,195,41,85,232,54,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
