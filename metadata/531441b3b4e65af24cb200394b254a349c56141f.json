Author Nigel French examines the design of magazine covers, dissecting the cover and explaining the purpose of the different components that make up the whole design. He then covers the design process from start to finish in Adobe InDesign, going on to show alternative workflows that exclusively use Photoshop and Illustrator. Each workflow shows you how to place and scale your image, position the masthead, add cover text, and package the end result as a print-ready PDF.\nTopics include:\n\n    The history of magazine covers\n    Choosing a cover image\n    Making color and tonal adjustments to the image\n    Placing and positioning the masthead\n    Positioning, scaling, and cropping the cover image\n    Creating a color palette\n    Adding cover text\n    Creating a peeling sticker effect\n    Preparing for print\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:531441b3b4e65af24cb200394b254a349c56141f","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Designing+a+Magazine+Cover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"531441b3b4e65af24cb200394b254a349c56141f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,20,65,179,180,230,90,242,76,178,0,57,75,37,74,52,156,86,20,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
