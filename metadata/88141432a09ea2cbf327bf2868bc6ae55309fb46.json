A visionary named Garrison Wade is building a railroad to connect Higbee to the Santa Fe. But a family named Clinton has its own selfish reasons for making sure these bands of steel go nowhere-and they've brought in a ruthless killer to derail Wade's plan.\n\nFalcon MacCallister owes a debt to the would-be railroad man Wade-and has a score to settle with the Clinton's hired gunman. But Falcon knows that Higbee is going to be torn to pieces; neighbors, families and lovers bitterly divided. For a man who has known war and peace, the fastest way to the end of a tragedy is straight through the blood and tears-behind the light of a blazing gun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88141432a09ea2cbf327bf2868bc6ae55309fb46","amp;dn":"William+Johnstone+-Eagles+13+Thunder+of+Eagles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88141432a09ea2cbf327bf2868bc6ae55309fb46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,20,20,50,160,158,162,203,243,39,191,40,104,188,106,229,83,9,251,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
