Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nTHE &quot;WOUNDED&quot; CITY: Chicago is on fire. Moody's dropped its bond rating to two levels above junk, mostly because they have quickly rising unfunded liabilities. Once they file bankruptcy, Chicago will be the largest municipal bankruptcy in the country's history.\n\nTHE FALL OF RAHM: Leftist hero Rahm Emmanuel was once the Chief of Staff to the president. Now he is the first mayor in Chicago's history to face a runoff election instead of easily winning re-election. Weirdly, he became unpopular because he did the right thing: he closed bad schools. He may have not been progressive enough for Chicago. His opponent &quot;Chuy&quot; Garcia could be even more irresponsible.\n\nGUN VIOLENCE: Chicago has one of the highest gun violence rates in the country. Economist John Lott says it's because the city has some of the strictest gun laws.\n\nPAY-TO-PLAY: Corruption in Chicago certainly isn't new. It continues, says Adam Andrzejewski of OpenTheBooks.com. Somehow, investment firms that give money to Emmanuel's campaign are awarded fees to manage the city's money. Somehow, lawyers who give the right politicians money get lucrative contracts from the city. What a coincidence!\n\nCHARTER SCHOOLS: One hopeful note in Chicago: almost 20% of the city's high school students now go to charter schools. This may allow a future generation to escape some of the damage done by unionized municipal bureaucracies.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.03.20.Chicago.The.Next.Detroit.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x264.XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 347 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 12s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 179 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 12s\nBit rate                                 : 1 041 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 296 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 24.070 fps\nOriginal frame rate                      : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 4.995 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.197\nStream size                              : 307 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1296 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 12s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.7 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9327c7f78a76d5539df0c03f59ee5b8eef212a99","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.03.20.Chicago.The.Next.Detroit.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9327c7f78a76d5539df0c03f59ee5b8eef212a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,39,199,247,138,118,213,83,157,240,192,63,89,238,91,142,239,33,42,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
