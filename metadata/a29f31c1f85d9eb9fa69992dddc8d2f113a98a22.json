However, that book was their 2nd edition.\n\nNeeding this newer edition for a different class as per syllabus requirement, this updated version biggest improvement is that the text, page formatting, and figures are much richer in color. The 2nd edition had this somewhat monotonous blue theme, but this one looks nicer (easier on the eyes) and will catch and retain your attention in reading it even if the information is nearly the same with various new figures and more examples compared to the older version. Perfect. Almost worth the (forced) upgrade..\n\nIf cost is a secondary factor, I recommend this book to anyone taking and learning fluid mechanics their first time.\n\nBook Description:\nCengel and Cimbala's Fluid Mechanics Fundamentals and Applications, communicates directly with tomorrow's engineers in a simple yet precise manner. The text covers the basic principles and equations of fluid mechanics in the context of numerous and diverse real-world engineering examples. The text helps students develop an intuitive understanding of fluid mechanics by emphasizing the physics, using figures, numerous photographs and visual aids to reinforce the physics. The highly visual approach enhances the learning of Fluid mechanics by students. This text distinguishes itself from others by the way the material is presented - in a progressive order from simple to more difficult, building each chapter upon foundations laid down in previous chapters. In this way, even the traditionally challenging aspects of fluid mechanics can be learned effectively","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29f31c1f85d9eb9fa69992dddc8d2f113a98a22","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics+-+Fundamentals+and+Applications+3rd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29f31c1f85d9eb9fa69992dddc8d2f113a98a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,159,49,193,248,93,158,185,250,105,153,45,221,200,210,241,19,169,138,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
