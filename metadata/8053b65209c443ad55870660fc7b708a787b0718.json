Manos Hadjidakis - Jamais Le Dimanche (Never On Sunday) OST (1960)\n\nNever On Sunday, the foreign-film hit of 1960-61, had two main things going for it. \nThe first was Melina Mercouri, playing a happy prostitute who works (you guessed it) six days a week; she won the best actress award at Cannes, was nominated for an Oscar, and became an international star. \nThe second was the score by Manos Hadjidakis, filled with lively bouzouki music and including the title tune, which became a Top 40 hit in both an instrumental recording by Don Costa and a vocal version by the Chordettes and won the Academy Award for best song. \nThis soundtrack album, on which Mercouri sings the song in Greek, was an even bigger hit, just missing #1 and staying in the charts over a year. The music has an enduring folkish appeal that continued to come across 38 years later, when the album was reissued on CD by Rykodisc.

Mikis Theodorakis - Phaedra OST (1962)\n\nOf course I was just a tiny baby when the movie &quot;Phaedra&quot; was released in the early 1960's, but both the film and the soundtrack left a lasting impression. \nThe film starring beautiful Melina Mercouri and a strangely cast Anthony Perkins is a modern version of the ancient Phaedra story. Phaedra was a queen married to a powerful &amp; self-involved ruler. Due to the jealousy of Aphrodite, Phaedra falls fatally in love with her stepson. In the modern version the King owns a shipyard &amp; parallels with the Onasis dynasty are pretty obvious.\nThe quality of the CD is excellent. You'd probably have to be a vintage movie fan to be interested, but the Love Theme is one of the best and conveys the awesome power of forbidden love &amp; obsession.
