No felony had ever gone unsolved while Sheriff Potts was in charge. In the next county, though, there is a vast estate known as &quot;The Kingdom.&quot; It's ruled by one man, John Wallace (Andy Griffith), whose power is absolute and beyond the law. But when Wallace chases one of his underlings to deliver ruthless punishment, he makes a critical mistake. He crosses over into Coweta County... Sheriff Potts' territory. This is the compelling true story of the man who ran the Kingdom, and the man who brought him down. Directed by Gary Nelson (Disney's &quot;The Black Hole&quot;) and co-starring Earl Hindman and June Carter Cash.\n\nOriginal Airdate: February 15, 1983\n\n*     *     *\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n- Feature Length Audio Commentary with Fan/Film Historian Bryan Hicks\n- 50th Anniversary News Restrospective\n- Recollections of a Coweta County Resident\n- Promotional Trailer\n- Vintage CBS Tuesday Night Movie Intro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1564a4115b08b73cce0c3e600cee284f46ee73e5","amp;dn":"MURDER+IN+COWETA+COUNTY+%281983%2C+CBS%29+Andy+Griffith%2FJohnny+Cash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1564a4115b08b73cce0c3e600cee284f46ee73e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,100,164,17,91,8,183,60,206,12,62,96,12,238,40,79,70,238,115,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
