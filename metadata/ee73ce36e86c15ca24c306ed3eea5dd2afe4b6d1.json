It also highlights MATLABÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built-in functions. These include interp1 function, the quad and dblquad functions, the inv function, the ode45 function, the fzero function, and many others. The second half of the text covers more advanced topics, including the iteration method for solving pipe flow problems, the Hardy-Cross method for solving flow rates in a pipe network, separation of variables for solving partial differential equations, and the use of Laplace transforms to solve both ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nThis book serves as a textbook for a first course in numerical methods using MATLAB to solve problems in mechanical, civil, aeronautical, and electrical engineering. It can also be used as a textbook or as a reference book in higher level courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee73ce36e86c15ca24c306ed3eea5dd2afe4b6d1","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Numerical+and+Analytical+Methods+with+MATLAB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee73ce36e86c15ca24c306ed3eea5dd2afe4b6d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,115,206,54,232,108,21,202,36,195,6,237,62,234,93,210,175,228,182,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
