Syro, unlike the Caustic Window LP released earlier this year, is not a collection of material cut during Richard JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ prolific 1990s heyday and shelved. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a new album of new music recorded in the last few years, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s said to be the first of more to come. Unlike MBV, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that James went away entirelyÃ¢â‚¬â€in 2005, he released a series of Analord 12&quot; EPs as AFX, and there were a couple of low-key EPs as the Tuss. But with many-monikered electronic musicians, branding is everything: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not an Aphex Twin release unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presented as an Aphex Twin release.\n\nSyro is an unusual album to contemplate because its overall approach is not particularly unusual. Older fans of electronic music who followed along with JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shape-shifting in the 1990s may need to adjust their expectations slightly. On the evidence here, he has no interest in re-inventing his sound. Syro has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come to DaddyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ vocals or rushes of noise. On the other end of the spectrum, Syro doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cast James in a quasi-classical light; there's no Ã¢â‚¬Å“serious composerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“4Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl/Boy SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that beg to be arranged for string quartet. And there are no Ã¢â‚¬Å“WindowlickerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-like nods to pop, no attempts to smuggle some truly weird music onto the charts.\n\nWithout all that, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left? Sixty-five minutes of highly melodic, superbly arranged, precisely mixed, texturally varied electronic music that sounds like it could have come from no other artist. James throughout the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s was an influence sponge; part of his genius was how he took ideas and ran them through his highly idiosyncratic filter. The bizarro highlights came when he put his own spin on genres, making jungle weirder, pop more unsettling, and piano music more gorgeous. Syro also absorbs many different sounds, from loping breakbeat to drumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢bass to techno proper to hints of disco, but in a more subtle way. It has a way of making other genres seem like they exist to serve this particular vision. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a confident album precisely because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not self-consciously pushing the envelope. Electronic music with a strong beat not intended for the dancefloor was, if not invented by this guy, certainly perfected by him. So with his first trip back from the wilderness, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demonstrating exactly how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done.\nTracklist:\n\n\n  1. Minipops 67 (Source Field Mix) (4:47)\n\n  2.
