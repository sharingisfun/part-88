Fontana, one of the top jazz soloists on his instrument, is featured on the first two tracks, &quot;A Beautiful Friendship&quot; and &quot;Sweet and Lovely.&quot; \n\nTenor sax and trumpet are added for the rest of the tunes, except the ballad &quot;Old Folks&quot; which features the tenor alone with the rhythm section. The soloist is Plas Johnson, a star in his own right, who is perhaps most widely remembered for his famous Pink Panther solo with Henry Mancini.\n\nJake Hanna was not a flashy drummer in the style of Buddy Rich, but he knew how to lead a rhythm section with the beauty and precision of the proverbial Swiss watch. For that he shares the credit with legendary players Dave McKenna on piano and Herb Ellis on guitar.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - A Beautiful Friendship\n02 - Sweet and Lovely\n03 - Jumpin' The Blues\n04 - Old Folks\n05 - Take The 'A' Train\n06 - I've Found A New Baby\n07 - I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart\n\n\n*1988 Concord Jazz | CCD-6011\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJake Hanna - Drums\nCarl Fontana - Trombone\nBill Berry - Trumpet\nHerb Ellis - Guitar\nPlas Johnson - Saxophone\nDave McKenna - Piano\nHerb Mickman - Bass\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
