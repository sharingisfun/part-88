Assuming only knowledge of elementary probability, complex analysis and optics, the book guides its reader through the fundamentals of vector and Hilbert spaces and the necessary quantum-mechanical ideas, simply formulated in four postulates. A turn to practical matters begins with and is then developed by:\n\nÃ‚Â· development of the concept of quantum decision, emphasizing the optimization of measurements to extract useful information from a quantum system;\nÃ‚Â· general formulation of a transmitterÃ¢â‚¬â€œreceiver system\nÃ‚Â· particular treatment of the most popular quantum communications systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€OOK, PPM, PSK and QAM;\nÃ‚Â· more realistic performance evaluation introducing thermal noise and system description with density operators;\nÃ‚Â· consideration of scarce existing implementations of quantum communications systems and their difficulties with suggestions for future improvement; and\nÃ‚Â· separate treatment of quantum information with discrete and continuous states.\n\nQuantum Communications develops the engineering studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exposure to quantum mechanics and shows physics students that its theories can have practically beneficial application in communications systems. The use of example and exercise questions (together with a downloadable solutions manual for instructors) will help to make the material presented really sink in for students and invigorate subsequent research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ee25014a6717bf8ff89ca6ca207b98c5ef7c55","amp;dn":"Quantum+Communications+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ee25014a6717bf8ff89ca6ca207b98c5ef7c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,238,37,1,74,103,23,191,143,248,156,166,202,32,123,152,197,239,124,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
