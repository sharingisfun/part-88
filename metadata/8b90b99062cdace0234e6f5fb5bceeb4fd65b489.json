Be it bourbon, rye, corn, Irish, or Scotch, whiskey has an infamous and celebrated history from a sometimes lethal, herb-infused concoction to a high-quality, meticulously crafted liquor.\n\nIn Whiskey, Kevin R. Kosar delivers an informative, concise narrative of the drink's history, from its obscure medieval origins to the globally traded product that it is today. Focusing on three nationsÃ¢â‚¬â€Scotland, Ireland, and AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€Kosar charts how the technique of distillation moved from ancient Egypt to the British Isles. Contrary to popular claims, there were no good old days of whiskey: before the twentieth century, consumers could never be sure just what was being poured in their cupÃ¢â‚¬â€unscrupulous profiteers could distill anything into booze and pawn it off as whiskey. Eventually, government and industry established legal definitions of what whiskey is and how it could be made, allowing for the distinctive styles of whiskey known today.\n\nWhiskey explains what whiskey is, how it is made, and how the types of whiskey differ. With a list of suggested brands and classic cocktail recipes for the thirsty reader, this book is perfect for drink and food enthusiasts and history lovers alike.\n\nBy Kevin Kosar\nPublished by Reaktion Books in 2011\nTags: nonfiction, economics, history, politics, food &amp; drink, ireland, scotland, whisky, bourbon, rye whiskey, scotch\nEPUB, Retail, 160 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b90b99062cdace0234e6f5fb5bceeb4fd65b489","amp;dn":"Whiskey%3A+A+Global+History+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b90b99062cdace0234e6f5fb5bceeb4fd65b489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,144,185,144,98,205,172,224,35,78,111,95,181,188,238,180,253,101,180,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
