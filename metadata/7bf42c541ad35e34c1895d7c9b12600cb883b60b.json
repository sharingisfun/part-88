Having just split up the original Mothers of Invention line-up, Zappa decided to sift through tapes of unused tracks by the band, which ultimately comprised BURNT WEENY SANDWICH (another compilation of outtakes, WEASELS RIPPED MY FLESH, would be issued one year later). The majority of the album is instrumental, and contains both live and studio material. Although the songs didn't surface the first time around, these aren't throwaways--many worthwhile Zappa cuts reside here.\n\nThe only compositions to contain vocals are the album's opener, &quot;WPLJ,&quot; and closer, &quot;Valarie.&quot; Both are essentially obscure doo-wop covers (Zappa covered doo-wop songs throughout his career), and are expertly performed. Symphonic music is touched upon with two brief tracks, &quot;Igor's Boogie (Phase One)&quot; and &quot;Igor's Boogie (Phase Two),&quot; as well as the lengthier &quot;Holiday in Berlin, Full Blown.&quot; &quot;Theme From Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; is guitar-driven rock, &quot;Aybe Sea&quot; is beautiful chamber music, and &quot;The Little House I Used To Live In&quot; is a nearly twenty-minute track, beginning as a solo piano piece before turning into a typically twisted Zappa rocker.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
