It is a sequel to Aliens versus Predator 2, although it does not have any connection with that game's plot. Instead it charts events on the planetBG-386, where a Weyland-Yutani research team led by Karl Bishop Weyland has discovered a Yautja Pyramid, and is simultaneously studying the Xenomorphs found there and hoping to unlock the advanced technology contained within. The Aliens soon escape, prompting a response from theUnited States Colonial Marine Corps, while the Predators also send three of their members to investigate.\n\nAliens vs. Predator is the fifth game in the Alien vs. Predator franchise. As with previous titles, it features three campaigns, one for each race/faction (the Predators, the Aliens and the Colonial Marines). These campaigns are separate in terms of individual plot and gameplay, but form one overlapping storyline.\n\nInstall by mounting the disk image\nDrag and drop the app to your preferred gaming folder\nDouble click the app to launch the game\n\nThis port includes the The Aliens vs Predator Unleashed mod: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-vs-predator-unleashed-edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-vs-predator-unleashed-edition&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTested on:\n2011 MacBook Pro\nIntel Quad Core i7 @ 2.3GHz\n16GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM\nRadeonHD 6750M w/ 512MB vRAM\nApprox. 17GB of HD space required\n\nThis port uses Wineskin 2.6.0 and WS9WineWineCX14.1.3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b50dc4754af7c9634ed4a1032648a2db756a64","amp;dn":"Aliens+vs+Predator+2010+%5BMac+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b50dc4754af7c9634ed4a1032648a2db756a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,181,13,196,117,74,247,201,99,78,212,161,3,38,72,162,219,117,106,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
