Gold has been discovered in the Yukon. New York is under the sway of Hearst and Pulitzer. And in a few months, an American battleship will explode in a Cuban harbor, plunging the U.S. into war. Spanning five years and half a dozen countries, this is the unforgettable story of that extraordinary moment: the turn of the twentieth century, as seen by one of the greatest storytellers of our time.\n\nShot through with a lyrical intensity and stunning detail that recall Doctorow and Deadwood both, A Moment in the Sun takes the whole era in its sightsÃ¢â‚¬â€from the white-racist coup in Wilmington, North Carolina to the bloody dawn of U.S. interventionism in the Philippines. Beginning with Hod Brackenridge searching for his fortune in the North, and hurtling forward on the voices of a breathtaking range of men and womenÃ¢â‚¬â€Royal Scott, an African American infantryman whose life outside the military has been destroyed; Diosdado ConcepcÃƒÂ­on, a Filipino insurgent fighting against his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new colonizers; and more than a dozen others, Mark Twain and President McKinleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassin among themÃ¢â‚¬â€this is a story as big as its subject: history rediscovered through the lives of the people who made it happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02431e129f2faa5bb4303a673f24c1fdb295cc0","amp;dn":"A+Moment+in+the+Sun+by+John+Sayles+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02431e129f2faa5bb4303a673f24c1fdb295cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,36,49,225,41,242,250,165,187,67,3,166,115,242,76,31,219,41,92,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
