Born in Louisiana, he moved north to be influenced by HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wolf and Muddy Waters, and developed a passionate, driving guitar style that made him a hero for blues-rockers from Eric Clapton to Jimmy Page. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise that the guests here include ZZ TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Billy Gibbons, who joins him on the stomping Wear You Out, and Van Morrison, who sings on the poignant Flesh &amp; Bone, a tribute to the late BB King. He may be surrounded by famous friends, but Guy dominates every song, from the upbeat Thick Like Mississippi Mud to the thoughtful lament, Come Back Muddy. Guy once explained that Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ final request to him was Ã¢â‚¬Å“keep the damn blues aliveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still doing just that. - http://www.theguardian.com\n\n\nGuitarist Buddy Guy Ã¢â‚¬â€ one of the last working giants from the electric blues' greatest generation Ã¢â‚¬â€ traces his life in mission and missing, from the crackling title cut to the B.B. King memorial &quot;Flesh and Blood,&quot; sung with Van Morrison, and &quot;Come Back Muddy,&quot; a message to Guy's late boss, Muddy Waters. Guy co-wrote just four songs here, but he sings and solos with reliable ferocity; two tracks with harpist Kim Wilson evoke his classic partnership with Junior Wells. &quot;I was born to play the guitar/People, I got blues running through my veins,&quot; Guy sings Ã¢â‚¬â€ lines he didn't write but lived. In the blues, that's what matters.\n\nRead more: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/buddy-guy-born-to-play-guitar-20150731#ixzz3hbIADm7Q","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e7c63ac4bc1d0b66772740185db26266ebb9a6","amp;dn":"Buddy+Guy+-+Born+To+Play+Guitar+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e7c63ac4bc1d0b66772740185db26266ebb9a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,231,198,58,196,188,29,11,102,119,39,64,24,93,178,98,102,235,185,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
