I use it as a reference for my students in graphic design classes. It's a beautifully concise summary of the history of graphic design styles - and gives visual examples as well as background information connected to the social forces that shaped the trends examined. If you are a student - it's a great first taste of the styles and movements that influence current graphic designers. If you are currently working in the field - it's a must have reference book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bf20afc2defa53bd7f72e417b7bc555bbef4d3","amp;dn":"Graphic+Style+-+From+Victorian+to+Post-Modern+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bf20afc2defa53bd7f72e417b7bc555bbef4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,191,32,175,194,222,250,83,189,127,114,228,23,183,188,85,91,190,244,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
