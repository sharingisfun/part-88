And Adguard application for Android works perfectly well.\n----------------------------------------------------\nWhat's new in version 2.0.62?\n1. Added the long-awaited firewall feature. Now it is possible to fully control the internet access of apps in different networks. The apps wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to go online and send any data without you knowing. In addition, by using our firewall, you can allow some apps to go to the network only via mobile Internet, while others (for example, ones that require a lot of traffic) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ only through Wi-Fi.\n2. Added app traffic monitoring system. You can monitor the consumption of app traffic in real time. Adguard will show you which apps consume resources at the moment, and demonstrate the used traffic for day, month or all-time.\n3. Added module for blocking advertising domains by DNS (can be found in advanced settings). DNS filtering consists in Adguard intercepting requests to the DNS server, which let the program know where the particular domain is, at what IP address. If requests to the domain should be blocked, then Adguard returns the special blocking response with a lifetime of 1 hour. During this hour, the program will no longer send requests to the DNS server, so the load will be reduced accordingly.\n4. Added Material Design. We have switched to the Material design.\n5. Added IPv6 filtering support. This protocol may not even be supported by your provider yet, and we have already added its support in VPN mode. Just keep using Adguard as if nothing has changed.\n6. Implemented blocking of QUIC protocol in Google Chrome. Google servers are working based on it, and also with its help Google Chrome loads banners and text ads. At the moment, the use of this protocol gives no significant advantage to the user, therefore we decided to block this protocol.\n7. Added simplified filtering mode without cosmetic rules. It is useful for low-end devices limited by memory and CPU resources. Banners are also wonderfully blocked, but once they are blocked, there will be Ã¢â‚¬Å“holesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that are usually hidden by some cosmetic rules that are present in other modes of filtering.\n8. Added the import function for user rules lists from a file.\n9. Added widget for your desktop, allowing one-click control for the ad-protection.\n10. Added options for update channel - Beta/Release. If you plan on using latest beta updates, don't forget to check the checkbox in advanced settings.\n11. Fixed problem with TCP-stack when downloading large files (in Google Play, etc.).\n12. Remarkably redesigned UDP and TCP connections handling, which led to the load reduction and increase of concurrent connections number.\n13. Use of system Intents to manage the service from other programs (Tasker, etc.) is now allowed.\n14. Improved restarting protection after reconnecting to the network.\n15. Fixed problem with sending MMS through the Verizon operator.\n16. Fixed sending SMS for T-Mobile users.\n17. Added support for NoChromo, Chrome Dev, Amazon Silk.\n18. Added an exception for new Opera Max, you can now use it with Adguard in proxy mode.\n19. Added new icons for different application states. Our notifications became more vivid and informative with new icons of pause, available update, or when a conflicting app is found on the device.\n20. No more status bar colored icon option in Lollipop. In new Android version Google has released a new design requirements, and when we assembled Adguard for the new system while using new technologies, a color icon was Ã¢â‚¬Å“damagedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by assembly tools. Therefore, we had to abandon the colored icon in the Android Lollipop notification (5.0+).\n21. Redesigned interface of user lists.\n22. Added new languages and updated existing localization.\n23.
