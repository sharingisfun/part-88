Owen\n\nOverview: The use of natural or naturally-derived antioxidants, instead of synthetic antioxidants, to produce foods with a longer shelf life and a higher degree of safety is a growing trend. Fruit and fruit-processing by-products are considered to be an important source of bioactive molecules (vitamins C, E, carotenoids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber) of great interest for the food industry, although their content varies greatly depending on origin, source, type of extract and concentration levels. This book discusses biological activity, potential applications and beneficial health effects of fruit and pomace extracts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83a0dd8ec1f4b45adc1fa3a71dd702e16116845","amp;dn":"Fruit+and+Pomace+Extracts%3A+Biological+Activity%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83a0dd8ec1f4b45adc1fa3a71dd702e16116845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,58,13,216,236,31,75,69,173,193,250,58,113,221,112,46,22,17,104,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
