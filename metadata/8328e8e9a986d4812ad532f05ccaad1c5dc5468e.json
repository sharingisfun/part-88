One of the last things he said to me was &quot; yous should make an album of guitar music&quot;.\n So here it is. It was recorded at home in my bedroom and carries all the limitations and glitches of being recorded on a shoe-string. \n I tried to keep it quite raw as he wasn't a fan of much &quot;modern&quot; music. This record got shelved right after I wrote most of the tracks,\n as it was a bit too much to finish at the time, too many emotions perhaps, but I liked it, I still like it and so I finished it.\n The influences are obvious, which was part of the plan. I wanted to make a record that sounded like all the records my dad loved.\n This album, at least the digital version, is free to anyone who wants to burn their own disc, share online, whatever.\n However if you do like it and want to show your support,\n please make a donation to your local stroke rehabilitation / research charity in memory of my father.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8328e8e9a986d4812ad532f05ccaad1c5dc5468e","amp;dn":"%5BPink+Floyd+style%5D+Mark+Salisbury+-+Nineteen+Fifty+One+2014+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8328e8e9a986d4812ad532f05ccaad1c5dc5468e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,40,232,233,169,134,212,129,42,213,50,240,92,202,173,28,93,197,70,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
