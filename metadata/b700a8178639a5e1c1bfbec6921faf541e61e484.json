It was centered on Vanth Dreadstar, sole survivor of the entire Milky Way galaxy, and an ensemble cast of crewmates, including cyborg sorcerer Syzygy Darklock, and their struggle to end an ancient war between two powerful, evil empires: The Church of The Instrumentality, run by the Lord Papal; and the Monarchy, administered by a puppet king.\n\nThe comic book, created by Jim Starlin, was bimonthly during most of its run. Epic published 26 issues, after which it was published by First Comics who carried it for 38 more issues, for a total of 64 issues. The first 41 issues were published bi-monthly, after which the book was published monthly for a time, though it resumed bi-monthly publication with issue 51. In the early 1990s, a six issue limited series was published by Malibu Comics' Bravura line of creator-owned titles. Jim Starlin had stated in interviews as early as 2000 that he was working on a new Dreadstar series titled &quot;Class Warfare&quot; (including sample artwork in Slave Labor Graphics' The Price trade paperback), but the last mention of this was in late 2002. In 2011, in promotion for 'Breed III, Starlin again mentioned the possibility of another Dreadstar series.\n\nList of files:\n[1980 - 1982] Metamorphosis Odyssey:\n01 - Metamorphosis Odyssey.cbr\n02 - Dreadstar - The Price.cbr\n03 - Marvel Graphic Novel #03 - Dreadstar.cbr\n\n[1982 - 1986] Epic:\nDreadstar 00 (from Epic 15).cbr\n2014 Dreadstar 01 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 02 (Epic).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 03 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 04 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 05 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 06 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 07 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 08 (Epic).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 09 (Epic).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 10 (Epic).cbr\nDreadstar 11 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 12 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 13 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 14 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 15 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 16 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 17 (Epic).cbz\n2011 Dreadstar 18 (Epic).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 19 (Epic).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 20 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 21 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 22 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 23 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 24 (Epic).cbz\nDreadstar 25 (Epic).cbr\n2014 DreadStar 26.cbr\nDreadstar 26 (Epic).cbr\n\n[1986 - 1991] First:\nDreadstar 27 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 28 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 29 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 30 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 31 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 32 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 33 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 34 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 35 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 36 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 37 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 38 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 39 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 40 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 41 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 42 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 43 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 44 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 45 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 46 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 47 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 48 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 49 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 50 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 51 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 52 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 53 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 54 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 55 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 56 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 57 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 58 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 59 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 60 (First).cbr\n2011 Dreadstar 61 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 62 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 63 (First).cbr\nDreadstar 64 (First).cbr\n\n[1994 - 1995] Malibu:\nDreadstar #1 of 6 (Malibu).cbr\nDreadstar #2 of 6 (Malibu).cbr\nDreadstar #3 of 6 (Malibu).cbr\nDreadstar #4 of 6 (Malibu).cbr\nDreadstar #5 of 6 (Malibu).cbr\nDreadstar #6 of 6 (Malibu).cbr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b700a8178639a5e1c1bfbec6921faf541e61e484","amp;dn":"Dreadstar+Complete+1980-1995+English+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b700a8178639a5e1c1bfbec6921faf541e61e484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,0,168,23,134,57,165,225,193,191,190,198,146,31,175,84,30,97,228,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
