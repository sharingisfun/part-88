Their lives are as mysterious as their gossamer wings are beautiful. In this book Pieter van Dokkum reveals many of the dragonflyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets, capturing the stages of this striking insectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life cycle in unprecedented close-up photographs. He documents scenes of dragonfly activity seldom witnessed and rarely photographed.\n\nThe book begins on a moonlit summer night, when an alien-looking larva crawls out of the water and transforms into a fully formed dragonfly. In the following chapters we witness dew-covered dragonflies sparkling in the morning sun, then a pair of mating dragonflies moving through the air in a twelve-legged, eight-winged dance. In the final chapter, one generation dies as the next prepares to leave the water and begin its own winged journey. Each stage is documented through van DokkumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inquisitive lens and accompanied by information on various species of dragonflies and damselflies, their metamorphosis, and their ecological importance as insect predators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea41ef6f0a6a96a6bf2e5130d5001bfc9897968","amp;dn":"Dragonflies%3A+Magnificent+Creatures+of+Water%2C+Air%2C+and+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea41ef6f0a6a96a6bf2e5130d5001bfc9897968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,164,30,246,240,166,169,106,107,242,229,19,13,80,1,191,201,137,121,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
