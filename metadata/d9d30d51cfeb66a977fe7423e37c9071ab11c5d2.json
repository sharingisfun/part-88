Does he or she seem to take longer than others to get stuff done--whether completing homework, responding when spoken to, or getting dressed and ready in the morning? Drs. Ellen Braaten and Brian Willoughby have worked with thousands of kids and teens who struggle with an area of cognitive functioning called &quot;processing speed,&quot; and who are often mislabeled as lazy or unmotivated. Filled with vivid stories and examples, this crucial resource demystifies processing speed and shows how to help kids (ages 5 to 18) catch up in this key area of development. Helpful practical tools can be downloaded and printed in a convenient 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; size. Learn how to obtain needed support at school, what to expect from a professional evaluation, and how you can make daily routines more efficient--while promoting your child's social and emotional well-being.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d30d51cfeb66a977fe7423e37c9071ab11c5d2","amp;dn":"Bright+Kids+Who+Cant+Keep+Up+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d30d51cfeb66a977fe7423e37c9071ab11c5d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,211,13,81,207,235,102,169,119,254,116,35,227,124,144,113,171,17,197,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
