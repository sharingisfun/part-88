Momoh\n\n2009 | 602 Pages | ISBN: 1420065866 | PDF | 32 MB\n\n\nAs the demand for energy continues to grow, optimization has risen to the forefront of power engineering research and development. Continuing in the bestselling tradition of the first edition, Electric Power System Applications of Optimization, Second Edition presents the theoretical background of optimization from a practical power system point of view, exploring advanced techniques, new directions, and continuous application problems.\n\nThe book provides both the analytical formulation of optimization and various algorithmic issues that arise in the application of various methods in power system planning and operation. The second edition adds new functions involving market programs, pricing, reliability, and advances in intelligent systems with implemented algorithms and illustrative examples. It describes recent developments in the field of Adaptive Critics Design and practical applications of approximate dynamic programming. To round out the coverage, the final chapter combines fundamental theories and theorems from functional optimization, optimal control, and dynamic programming to explain new Adaptive Dynamic Programming concepts and variants.\nWith its one-of-a-kind integration of cornerstone optimization principles with application examples, this second edition propels power engineers to new discoveries in providing optimal supplies of energy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91715a047bc08e3ac35848498954ae421e3ffb0e","amp;dn":"Electric+Power+System+Applications+of+Optimization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91715a047bc08e3ac35848498954ae421e3ffb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,113,90,4,123,192,142,58,195,88,72,73,137,84,174,66,30,63,251,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
