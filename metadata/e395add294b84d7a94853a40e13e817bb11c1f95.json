A wide range of optimization methods - deterministic, stochastic, global and hybrid - are considered. Containing papers presented at the bilateral workshop by British and Lithuanian scientists, the book brings together researchers' contributions from different fields - chemical engineering including reaction and separation processes, food and biological production, as well as business cycle optimization, bankruptcy, protein analysis and bioinformatics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e395add294b84d7a94853a40e13e817bb11c1f95","amp;dn":"Computer+Aided+Methods+in+Optimal+Design+and+Operations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e395add294b84d7a94853a40e13e817bb11c1f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,149,173,210,148,184,77,122,148,133,58,64,225,62,129,123,177,28,31,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
