Behind the pretty faÃƒÂ§ade, however, is a town at war: rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. A miniseries adaptation of J.K. Rowling's novel.\n\nEpisode 3 of 3:\n\nWith the parish council election imminent, tensions rise in Pagford as each side steps up their campaign. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? The battle lines are drawn, and the fate of Sweetlove House hangs in the balance.\n\n=====================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 336MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 703Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n=====================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab2431991f5301d16da8bf216d776cf62025c12","amp;dn":"The+Casual+Vacancy+S01E03+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab2431991f5301d16da8bf216d776cf62025c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,178,67,25,145,245,48,29,22,218,139,242,22,215,118,207,98,2,92,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
