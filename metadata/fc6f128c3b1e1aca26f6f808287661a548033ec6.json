Also included are five unique pieces of polyrhythmic polyphony for percussion and African thumb pianos, painting a picture of legendary West Coast skull collector Ray Bandar. Poignant exotica, moonlit moods, bizarre percussion and several tracks of manic intensity. \n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista: Percussion\nShanir Ezra Blumenkranz: Bass\nJon Madof: Guitar\nKenny Wollesen: Drums, Percussion\nJohn Zorn: Wurlitzer Piano, African Thumb Pianos \n\n    &quot;Menken&quot; - 5:26\n    &quot;Skull I&quot; - 4:04\n    &quot;Glimpses&quot; - 6:37\n    &quot;Mood Mondrian&quot; - 4:31\n    &quot;Skull II&quot; - 3:31\n    &quot;Gogogo&quot; - 8:14\n    &quot;Moonplay&quot; - 4:42\n    &quot;Skull III&quot; - 3:02\n    &quot;Tango Exotique&quot; -5:04\n    &quot;Zenscapes&quot; - 1:09\n    &quot;Skull IV&quot; - 1:41\n    &quot;Arabesque&quot; - 5:10\n    &quot;Skull V&quot; - 2:23\n    &quot;Bolex Dancing&quot; - 1:37\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc6f128c3b1e1aca26f6f808287661a548033ec6","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+17+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc6f128c3b1e1aca26f6f808287661a548033ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,111,18,140,59,30,26,202,38,246,248,8,40,118,97,165,72,3,62,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
