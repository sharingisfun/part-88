The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hazard Analysis and Critical Control PointÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (HACCP) approach, which is applied for this purpose, is dedicated to the study and the analysis of all possible dangers by food consumptions and the related countermeasures with the aim of protecting the health of consumers. This difficult objective is highly multidisciplinary and requires a plethora of different competencies. This book thus addresses chemists, microbiologists, food technologists, medical professionals and veterinarians. The chemical risks described in this book are related to food additives, contaminants by food packaging materials, chemicals from cleaning systems and microbial toxins. The present book gives an introduction and overview of these various topics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd3df01ebfbcc41f701c05b39aaf72eae55f6f6f","amp;dn":"Microbial+Toxins+and+Related+Contamination+in+the+Food+Industry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd3df01ebfbcc41f701c05b39aaf72eae55f6f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,61,240,30,191,188,196,31,112,28,5,179,154,175,114,234,229,95,111,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
