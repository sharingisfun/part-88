Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nMONEY, MONEY, MONEY\n\nCHANGE FOR A $10? The Treasury plans to put a woman on the $10 bill. We don't know who, but people we asked in Times Square still seemed excited about the decision. I feel bad about Alexander Hamilton's demotion. He was a big deal: he helped pass our new Constitution, fought in the American Revolution, rescued the country from debt, and founded the New York Post. Most people don't know this.\n\nSHOW ME THE MONEY! Economics confuses people. That's why John Tamny uses entertaining stories from sports, movies, and pop culture to explain basic economics in his new book &quot;Popular Economics: What the Rolling Stones, Downton Abbey, and LeBron James Can Teach You about Economics.&quot;\n\nUNEQUAL PAYCHECKS: Hillary Clinton complains &quot;the top 25 hedge fund managers mak[e] more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined.&quot; I say, &quot;so what,&quot; and explain how the market sets wages.\n\nZERO SAVINGS: 3 out of 5 Americans have no savings, and the average household owes more than $7,000 on their credit cards. Radio host Dave Ramsey counsels people on how to better manage their money.\n\nCASH ONLY: Crystal Paine has never used a credit card and avoids debt by paying for everything in cash.\n\nGOING BROKE: Politicians should also learn how to manage taxpayers' money. Even though America's $18 trillion debt keeps increasing, many politicians insist on more spending.\n\nMY TAKE: Let's eliminate the Washington monopoly on printing money. Let private currencies, like bitcoin or Dogecoin, compete for your business. Choice is always better!\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.06.26.Money.Money.Money.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7becc778dea7780554206835b77235e0827e0fdc","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.06.26.Money.Money.Money.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7becc778dea7780554206835b77235e0827e0fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,236,199,120,222,167,120,5,84,32,104,53,183,114,53,224,130,126,15,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
