In particular, the critical factors affecting in situ materials are examined, such as deterioration and the behaviour and durability of materials under performance. An accessible, easy-to-follow approach makes this book ideal for all diploma and undergraduate students on construction-related courses taking a module in construction materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef555b01e55703d60e5ef7285ac5fcf4baa4d231","amp;dn":"Materials+Science+In+Construction%3A+An+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef555b01e55703d60e5ef7285ac5fcf4baa4d231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,85,91,1,229,87,3,214,14,94,247,40,90,197,252,244,186,164,210,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
