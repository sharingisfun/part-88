Storm Warning [Broken Heartland, #1] - Elizabeth Lee &amp; Caisey Quinn\n\nSometimes you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see the storm coming until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late...\n\nSevere Storm Warning Tip #1:\nBe alert to changing weather conditions. Look for approaching storms.\n\nSevere Storm Warning Tip #2:\nIf you see approaching storms or any of the danger signs, be prepared to take shelter immediately.\n\nSevere Storm Warning Tip #3:\nThey may strike quickly, with little or no warning.\n\nSituated just outside of Oklahoma City, Calumet County is divided into two drastically different communities: HopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grove and Summit Bluffs. One is the small backward town where dirt roads lead the way to field parties and railroad tracks. And the other, a sprawling suburb where paved drives lead to the landscaped lawns of the wealthy and over privileged.\n\nFor five teenagers smack in the middle of Tornado Alley, summer is heating up fast. The winds of change are blurring the invisible line that divides the rich and the rural.\n\nOne has a secret.\nOne has a crush.\nOne has been lying.\nOne will get caught.\nAnd one might not make it out alive.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from two different worldsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but one summer is about to change everything.\n\n02. Path of Destruction [Broken Heartland, #2] - Elizabeth Lee &amp; Caisey Quinn\n\nThey ignored the warning signs and it cost them everything...\n\nAt the end of a life-changing summer a devastating tornado hit the small town of HopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grove, Oklahoma.\n\nWhile the brick suburban mansions of Summit Bluffs saw very little damage, their occupants werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so lucky. As the members of both communities struggle to put the pieces of their lives back together, lies will be told, truths will be revealed, and nothing will ever be the same. The road to recovery is long and paved with past hurts and future heartbreaks.\n\nThey ignored the warning signs, and one of them didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it out alive. The four that remain know theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be crazy to think the storms are actually over..\n\nBecause itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just when you think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re safe that you find yourself right in the path of destruction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ca9af683e15befc268c3255845ada6b30874c2","amp;dn":"Broken+Heartland+Series+-+Elizabeth+Lee+%26amp%3B+Caisey+Quinn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ca9af683e15befc268c3255845ada6b30874c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,202,154,246,131,225,91,239,194,104,195,37,88,69,173,166,179,8,116,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
