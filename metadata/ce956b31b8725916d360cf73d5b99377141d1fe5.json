It is geared toward for scientists, material engineers, designers, manufacturing engineers, and technologists who need practical guidance rather than theoretical instruction.\n\nThe process of selecting solders has changed. Demanding service environments and rigorous specifications require that the precise details of a soldering process be worked out in advance rather than left to the end. The design of a soldering process has thus become part and parcel of the product design process itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce956b31b8725916d360cf73d5b99377141d1fe5","amp;dn":"Soldering%3A+Understanding+the+Basics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce956b31b8725916d360cf73d5b99377141d1fe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,149,107,49,184,114,89,22,211,96,207,115,213,185,147,119,20,29,31,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
