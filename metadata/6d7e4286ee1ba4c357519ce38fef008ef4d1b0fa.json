The band relocated to London, England, in May 1982. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described Dead Can Dance's style as &quot;constructed soundscapes of mesmerising grandeur and solemn beauty; African polyrhythms, Gaelic folk, Gregorian chant, Middle Eastern mantras and art rock.&quot;\n\nContinuing in the vein of the self-titled debut but more clearly plunging into a wider range of music and style, Garden is the clear transition between the group's competent but derivative goth start and something much, much more special. Opening track &quot;Carnival of Light&quot; captures the blend at play, with rolling drums, dulcimer, processed guitar and more creating a swirling, evocative mix of sound at once new and old. Gerrard's simply lovely vocals are further icing on the cake. &quot;Flowers of the Sea&quot; is another similarly entrancing effort, simpler in arrangement but no less hypnotic. The remaining numbers, &quot;The Arcane&quot; and the wordily-entitled &quot;In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated,&quot; follow the first album's general pattern -- Perry is again a fantastic singer, but the songs themselves aren't as memorable, embracing doomy goth sonics without adding much to the overall sonic canon.\n\nDFF files extracted with Scarletbook\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the 2008 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab SACD.\n\nSACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d7e4286ee1ba4c357519ce38fef008ef4d1b0fa","amp;dn":"Dead+Can+Dance+-+Garden+Of+...+%281984%29+2008+MFSL-SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d7e4286ee1ba4c357519ce38fef008ef4d1b0fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,126,66,134,238,27,164,195,87,81,156,227,143,239,0,142,244,209,176,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
