Supposedly this is compatible with Linux variants, but it seems the app is a bit out of date as links to the required libraries to accomplish this task are broken.\n\nI have included this library so you can use the application.\nThis is a repack. The application is useless without the library.\n\nMay or may not be compatible with newer versions on Linux you will have to check yourselves.I dont have a dual boot setup to test this.\n\nThis is an open source app and thereby beer-ware.\n\nTo answer your question, TC is not dead. Its called CipherShed now.If you want full disk encryption, use that,LUKS, or Bitlocker, though BitLocker is moot point as its crackable on Linux with dislocker utils","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6a141f0b0b2de96529a2dc3e98fa895187a6ac","amp;dn":"encfs4win.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6a141f0b0b2de96529a2dc3e98fa895187a6ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,106,20,31,11,11,45,233,101,41,162,220,62,152,250,137,81,135,166,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
