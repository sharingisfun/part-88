This is the first book that contains detailed and comprehensive analysis of two currently extensively studied subjects of atomic and quantum physicsÃ¢â‚¬â€¢atomic correlations and their relations to entanglement between atoms or atomic systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€¢along with the newest developments in these fields.\n\nThis book assembles accounts of many phenomena related to or resulting from atomic correlations. The essential language of the book is in terms of density matrices and master equations that provide detailed theoretical treatments and experimental analysis of phenomena such as entanglement between atoms, spontaneously or externally induced atomic coherence, engineering of atomic correlations, storage and controlled transfer of correlations, and dynamics of correlated systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:623da6464c2b19971198fcb7c355439bd1fd4971","amp;dn":"Quantum+Optics+for+Beginners+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"623da6464c2b19971198fcb7c355439bd1fd4971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,61,166,70,76,43,25,151,17,152,252,183,195,85,67,155,209,253,73,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
