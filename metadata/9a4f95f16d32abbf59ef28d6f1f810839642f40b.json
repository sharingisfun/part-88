Happy Daze 03:45\n\nThroughout the twists and turns of the 14 track LP, it becomes clear that the foursome share an uncompromising musical vision. Daily Meds have crafted THE album which has been so sorely missing from the local hip hop landscape, focusing on forward thinking production and relevant social issues the songs on Happy Daze can impact a full room of party goers equally as someone listening at home. \n\nOn Happy Daze, it quickly becomes clear that P.Smurf and Mikoen are two of the fastest MCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Sydney, with double time rapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s becoming the norm for Daily Meds. Matched with powerful R&amp;B/Pop inspired vocals from Billie Rose and producer RoleoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack for hard-hitting beats Happy Daze showcases the raw and intense energy that the crew has become known for over the years. \n\nDaily Meds is more than just a party crew though, and lyrically there is depth to their songs, real life experience meets philosophical self-realization, and the crew is unashamed of wearing their views and experience on their sleeves, from sordid tales and party escapades to the inherent social and political issues faced by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youth.\n\n\nReleased 13 April 2012 \n\nBeats - Roleo \nRaps - P.Smurd \nRaps - Mikoen \nRaps/Vocals - Billie Rose","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a4f95f16d32abbf59ef28d6f1f810839642f40b","amp;dn":"Daily+Meds+-+Happy+Daze+%282012%29+mp3+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a4f95f16d32abbf59ef28d6f1f810839642f40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,79,149,241,109,50,171,191,89,239,40,214,241,248,16,131,150,66,244,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
