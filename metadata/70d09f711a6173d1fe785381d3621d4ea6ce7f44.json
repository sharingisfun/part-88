Caribe, a composition by Michel Camilo, opens with a piano solo by Hilton Ruiz and Brazilian forest sounds. Actually they are coming from the collection of percussion instruments used, and in some cases invented, by Airto. Then Dizzy shows how at home he is in the complexities of Latin rhythms. The burning tenor solo is by Bob Berg.\n2. Friday Night at the Cadillac Club is a piece Bob Berg wrote to recall a rough-and-ready New Jersey nightclub where he used to work. He plays the tertor solo, which is followed by a hot but pretty trumpet solo by Art Farmer, then some typically all-out alto by Phil Woods, earthy guitar from Robben Ford, and a steaming organ solo by Jim Beard.\n3. Quilombo. It is more than twenty-five years since the bossa nova movement burst on the United States and we became familiar with the propulsive character of Brazilian guitar and percussion. That sound is still there, but a good many younger songwriters and singers have come up, one of the most exciting being Gilberto Gil. This is his song. The guitar is that of Romero Lubambo, the voices are led by Flora Purim. Phil Woods plays eight bars leading into a duet with Bob Berg. Airto shouts encouragement from behind his percussion instruments, and then Art Farmer comes in again. As Dizzy said, &quot;Art Farmer plays so pretty.&quot;\n4. Barbados, This is a blues by Charlie Parker and, appropriately, Phil Woods, one of his most brilliant successors, leads it off. The bassist is the wonderful Charlie Haden, another of the imiversalists who have grown up in jazz.\n5. Waiting for Angela is an exquisite ballad by Toninho Horta, with lyrics by Flora Purim. Bob Berg plays the soprano saxophone obligato and solo. The lovely synthesizer work is that of Jim Beard.\n6. Nana is by the outstanding Brazilian multi-instrumentalist and composer Moarir Santos. One of the things Santos has done is to draw such American influences as bugaloo into the music of Brazil. This is an example of this kind of alloy. Bob Berg and Phil Woods are featured. Jim Beard plays the funk-filled piano solo.\n7. Softly as in a Morning Sunrise is from the 1928 musical The New Moon. Creed Taylor drily commented, as Art Farmer and Romero Lubambo began it, &quot;You know, Sigmund Romberg didn't write this as a samba.&quot; But it works beautifully that way. This track occurred utterly impromptu at the session. Art plays flugelhom, his usual instrument in recent years.\n8. Colo de Rio is by Enio Flavio Mol and Marcelo Ferreira. The amazing thing is the facility and intonation with which Flora negotiates the high-speed syllables. Phil Woods, Art Farmer, Bob Berg, and Romero Lubambo are soloists, with lovely synthesizer effects from Jim Beard.\n9. Palisades in Blue is by Benny Golson, the widely admiredÃ¢â‚¬â€and widely playedÃ¢â‚¬â€jazz composer who co-led the celebrated Jazztet with Art Farmer. After many years as a film and television composer, BennyÃ¢â‚¬â€who arranged this albumÃ¢â‚¬â€has returned full-time to the jazz world. This tune somewhat recalls his earlier and hugely successful Killer Joe. The soloists are Phil Woods, Art Farmer, Bob Berg, Robben Ford, and Jimmy McGriff.\n10. Wamba was written by the African composer Salif Keita. The opening time signature is six-eight, but the song is, in fact, polyrhythmic. Bob Berg, Airto, Flora Purim, Tito Puente, Phil Woods, and Dizzy are featured. Airto and Tito play a percussion duet, followed by Dizzy's Rhythmstick exchanges with Tito's timbales. Dizzy is in the center channel; you can hear him tapping the stick on the floor as the synthesizer comes in. Dizzy picks up his famous trumpet and becomes the center of it all; he has been for more than forty years, this American national treasure.\n                                              \n\n                                                                                                                                                        Gene Lees (from Liner Notes)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GpcrUPG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GpcrUPG.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/j8irR08.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/j8irR08.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
