However, one of Delos's most famous critics, reporter Chuck Browning, is still not convinced that Delos has cleaned up its act,  especially after an informant with inside information about Delos is murdered. Chuck teams up with fellow reporter Tracy Ballard and goes to Delos to find out  why his source was killed. What they discover is beyond any of their imaginations. - Written by Lee Horton\nSubtitles: Dan, Dut, Fin, Rom\n\n\nSource-------- EUR BD-s\nReleased------ 2014/09/21 @HDA\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 4GB / 4.2GB\nLength-------- 1:25:07 (25fps) / 1:47:29 (23.976fps)\nVideo Bit rate ~6.5 MBps / ~5MBps\nResolution---- 1280x532 / 1280x688\nAudio--------- ENG DD 2.0 @320KBps / GER DD 2.0 @320 (Futureworld 1976 only)\nScreens------ &lt;a href=&quot; http://imgbox.com/g/xeTDsAhTkx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imgbox.com/g/xeTDsAhTkx&lt;/a&gt;\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5964ed98ceab3c45fa5c3d377305a1b282654b8a","amp;dn":"Westworld+1973+%26amp%3B+Futureworld+1976+BDRip+720p+DD+2.0+multisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5964ed98ceab3c45fa5c3d377305a1b282654b8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,100,237,152,206,171,60,69,250,92,61,55,115,5,161,178,130,101,75,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
