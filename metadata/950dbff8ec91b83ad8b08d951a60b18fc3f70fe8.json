Includes a Concert Edition of the film with no dialogue, to experience the visuals.\n\nThis is the official bittorrent release, uploaded by the creator.\n\n13min\n\n\n== SYNOPSIS ==\n\nRyan lives in Brooklyn and looks for a job, maybe in social media or something. He sits around the house, wanders New York City, and questions the point of his existence. Bridging experimental and narrative form, Lily is like attending a live string quartet concert that explodes into the visual field.\n\nThe film flits into the future and past and back while an original score, written in the style of BeÃŒï¿½la BartoÃŒï¿½k, tells its own piece of the story.\n\nDraped in kaleidoscopic imagery and crackling with dark humor, Lily in the Grinder probes sex, death, and time. What if a human life is a static, four-dimensional entity that cannot be said to truly begin or end?\nWhat if we are already everything we will ever be?\n\n\n== CONTAINS ==\n\n* Main edition of the film (5mbit, 1080p, Quicktime h.264)\n* Concert edition of the film with no dialogue (5mbit, 1080p, Quicktime h.264)\n* High-quality poster and album cover\n\n\n\n== NOTE FROM MICHAEL ==\n\nHey there,\n\nThank you for downloading the film! Bittorrent is a double-edged sword. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier than almost any other method to get high-quality content, but it also threatens to make filmmaking unsustainable for creators.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extras on the site at lilyinthegrinder.com so I hope you check it out.\n\nIt took a lot of money to make Lily in the Grinder, so if you like it, feel free to send something via PayPal toActually Ã¢â‚¬â€ it would mean even more if you would share the film, send it to friends, or embed it on your blog. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made it easy to embed with a single line of code, which you can find on the site.\n\nThanks very much and enjoy the film.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Morgenstern\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c5a8aca6ada4a0a985a0b3a0b7bcb1adacaba2acb6a0b3a0b7bcb1adacaba2eba6aaa8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:950dbff8ec91b83ad8b08d951a60b18fc3f70fe8","amp;dn":"Lily+in+the+Grinder+%282014%29+-+Short+film+about+existence+-+Offici","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"950dbff8ec91b83ad8b08d951a60b18fc3f70fe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,13,191,248,236,145,184,58,216,176,141,149,26,96,177,143,195,247,15,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
