Because the FAT file system (FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT) does not support UNIX file ownership or permissions and will cause a security breakdown of app's private files.\nLink2SD does not create the second partition, you need to create it yourself.\n\nLinking obb and external data folders of apps and games\n- root permission\n\nSecond partition on SD card is optional, folders can be moved to the 1st or 2nd second partition of the SD card.\n\nLink2SD also provides native App2SD feature of Android OS. It can move any user apps to SD card (force move), with batch moving capability.\n\nLink2SD is a free (ad supported) app, you can upgrade to Link2SD Plus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3058dcbb4114f042b3644bfc5e69940b1d3d078","amp;dn":"Link2SD+v4.0.11+Unlocked+APK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3058dcbb4114f042b3644bfc5e69940b1d3d078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,5,141,203,180,17,79,4,43,54,68,191,197,230,153,64,177,211,208,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
