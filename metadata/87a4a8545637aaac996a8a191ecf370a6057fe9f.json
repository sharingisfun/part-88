This chart shows and monitors how much of your Android phone / tablet CPU is being used. You can see a live display of what is excessively overloading your CPU and kill the application. You can also see which Apps run without you using them excessively and delete them if you choose. I have found Apps running without my using them and deleted them as was my preference.
