Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - fixed TwbT overrides when installing with PyLNP\n - updated PyLNP to v0.5.2; fixes entombing pets option\n - completely reworked dfhack tabs\n   - multilevel view now always-on through dfhack.init\n   - options now invoked via 'onLoadWorld.init' rather than\n     script in dfhack.init; fixes overlap and overwriting\n   - new automation options, non-persistent (ie unchecking box will disable)\n   NB: if an option is enabled in *either tab*, it will be active now\n - enabled UI prompts for autochop and stocks plugins\n - updated soundSense to version 2014-1\n - bugfixes run ingame-monthly instead of only on startup\n\nMD5:  EA429D550575EC9214D4934595FD5CC8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d345dd751f92ebe7368c012a8ce4b76645aa0ce5","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_13+Starter+Pack+r2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d345dd751f92ebe7368c012a8ce4b76645aa0ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,69,221,117,31,146,235,231,54,140,1,42,140,228,183,102,69,170,12,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
