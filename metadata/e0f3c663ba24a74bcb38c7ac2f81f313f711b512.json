From Afghanistan Jesus went to Kashmir where some Israelite tribes had also settled. He made this place his home and here he died and lies buried in Srinagar, Kashmir. \n\nIn this book, The author has solved another difficult problem which has for long confounded many a western writer, namely the problem of the resemblance between Christian and Buddhistic teachings and also between the life of Jesus and that of Buddha, as recorded in their respective Scriptures. Some of these writers hold that Buddhistic teachings must somehow have reached Palestine and were incorporated by Jesus in his own sermons. But there is absolutely no historical evidence to support this theory. A Russian traveller named Nicolas Notovitch stayed for quite some time with Lamas in Tibet and had their religious chronicles translated for him. He is of the opinion that Jesus must have been to Tibet before the Crucifixion and gone back to Palestine after having imbibed Buddhistic teachings. \n\nRejecting both these views, the author proves that Jesus came to India only after the Crucifixion and not before, and that it was not he who borrowed Buddha's teachings but the Buddhists who seem to have reproduced the Gospels in their books. Jesus also visited Tibet during his travels in India in search of the lost tribes of Israel.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
