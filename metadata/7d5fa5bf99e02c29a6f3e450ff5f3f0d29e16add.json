If you don't want a database, those are the only files you need.\n\nSince the artwork is barely compressed, you may like to compress them more for faster web delivery. A PHP script called &quot;compress.php&quot; is included. It requires the PHP Imagick extension, and you'll need to edit the source and destination directories specified within the code, as well as possibly change the JPG compression quality from its current value of 90. You could also compress the entire structure with a Photoshop batch process, the command-line ImageMagick, or similar utilities.\n\nDATABASE and PHP\n\nThe artwork can work with a PHP script that allows a full text search of the strips' dialog and occasional narrative descriptions, a chronological slideshow, and a date-based table of contents.\n\nThe textual database comes from a transcription I can no longer locate, but appears to be the source of the search engine at http://michaelyingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/ (Note that this site doesn't have any artwork, but merely links to the low-res artwork at gocomics.com)\n\nand also derives browseable HTML obtained from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://marcel-oehler.marcellosendos.ch/comics/ch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://marcel-oehler.marcellosendos.ch/comics/ch/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote that the above 105MB archive also contains artwork, but in very low-res GIF format. This is far below the quality of this 2GB release.\n\nTwo MySQL table dumps are included. The main table is in &quot;ch.sql&quot;, and a related table of published collection books is in &quot;chbooks.sql&quot;\n\nYou'll have to adjust the database connection info within the databaseOpen() function in the &quot;misc.php&quot; include file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d5fa5bf99e02c29a6f3e450ff5f3f0d29e16add","amp;dn":"Calvin.and.Hobbes.Organized.2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d5fa5bf99e02c29a6f3e450ff5f3f0d29e16add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,95,165,191,153,224,44,41,166,243,228,80,255,95,63,13,41,225,106,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
