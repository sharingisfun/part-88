Ant then gets into the news story of a beheading in Oklahoma, shows us a clip from Bill Maher, one from The View, and also discusses Muslims and their laws. He shows us full bush from American Apparel, tells a few pube stories, and takes some calls. Ant goes through some new Ã¢â‚¬Å“fan mail,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ updates us on Belle Knox, tells us a story about a woman/pig, and waxes on the new iPhone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f82aef47f8268946c232d119f0db3090170f87d","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f82aef47f8268946c232d119f0db3090170f87d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,130,174,244,127,130,104,148,108,35,45,17,159,13,179,9,1,112,248,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
