The text is in English but with some words translated to French since it was originally targeted to Polymers Science students of Aix-Marseille University. As the title says, equations and theoretical models are reduced to the bare minimum, in the attempt to help the reader to understand as much as possible the Physics behind rheological measurements. \n\n***************************************************************************\n\nTable of contents\n\n\nBasics of Rheology\t\n1.1 Stress and strain.
