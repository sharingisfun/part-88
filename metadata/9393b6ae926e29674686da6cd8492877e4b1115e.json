It is the first album without former guitarist Richie Sambora, who left the band in 2013. \nAccording to Jon Bon Jovi, the album serves as a &quot;fan record&quot; to tie in with an accompanying international tour: &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t finished, that were finished, a couple of new ones like the one we released as a single &quot;We Don't Run&quot;.\n\nBurning Bridges will be followed by the band's fourteenth studio album in 2016.\nThe first single &quot;Saturday Night Gave Me Sunday Morning&quot; had its premiere at the Austrian Radio Ãƒâ€“3 Hitradio on July 17, 2015, and was released on July 31, 2015.\n\n Originally written in The Circle sessions, it was finished for this album. \nThe song has been reviewed as a happy pop-rock song with a classic Bon Jovi sound that it's not too far away form the sound of the last two albums.\n\nThe second single, &quot;We Don't Run,&quot; premiered at the Brazilian radio Radio Rock on July 20, 2015, and was released on July 31, 2015. \nIt's a drum and bass driven rock song, with &quot;meaty production and a shredding guitar solo&quot;. Unlike the previous single, this song was written exclusively for Burning Bridges.\n\nThough not released as singles, the songs &quot;Blind Love&quot; and &quot;A Teardrop to the Sea&quot; were digitally released on August 7, 2015, followed by &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; on August 13, 2015.\n\nLyrics videos for all the songs have been released on Bon Jovi's YouTube account.\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;A Teardrop to the Sea&quot;   \tJon Bon Jovi, Billy Falcon \t5:07\n2. \t&quot;We Don't Run&quot;   \tBon Jovi, John Shanks \t3:17\n3. \t&quot;Saturday Night Gave Me Sunday Morning&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Shanks, Richie Sambora \t3:23\n4. \t&quot;We All Fall Down&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Shanks \t4:05\n5. \t&quot;Blind Love&quot;   \tBon Jovi \t4:48\n6. \t&quot;Who Would You Die For&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Falcon \t3:54\n7. \t&quot;Fingerprints&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Falcon \t5:58\n8. \t&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Falcon, Chris DeStefano \t3:22\n9. \t&quot;I'm Your Man&quot;   \tBon Jovi, Shanks \t3:44\n10. \t&quot;Burning Bridges&quot;   \tBon Jovi \t2:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9393b6ae926e29674686da6cd8492877e4b1115e","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Burning+Bridges+%282015%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9393b6ae926e29674686da6cd8492877e4b1115e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,147,182,174,146,110,41,103,70,134,218,108,216,73,40,119,228,177,17,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
