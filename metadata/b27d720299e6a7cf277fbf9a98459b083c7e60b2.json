Now he is finally able to return - but only for three days. How will his old friends react to him, and will their relationships be able to stand the test of time?\n\nFor a person whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been afraid of change, this is a worrying prospect for our heroÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something he will have to overcome if he can ever hope to right his past wrongs. And a failure to do so can result in some rather unpleasant outcomes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27d720299e6a7cf277fbf9a98459b083c7e60b2","amp;dn":"The+Way+We+All+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27d720299e6a7cf277fbf9a98459b083c7e60b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,125,114,2,153,230,167,207,39,127,191,154,152,69,155,8,60,126,96,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
