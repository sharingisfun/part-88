Morgan\n\nBook description: The Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Sport is a landmark publication in sport studies. It goes further than any book has before in tracing the contours of the discipline of the philosophy of sport and in surveying the core themes, approaches and theories that form its disciplinary fabric. The book explores the ways in which an understanding of philosophy can inform our understanding of important prevailing issues in sport. Edited by two of the most significant figures in the development of the philosophy of sport, Mike McNamee and Bill Morgan, and with contributions from many of the world's leading sport philosophers, this is an invaluable companion reference volume for any course in the social scientific study of sport, and an essential addition to the bookshelf of any serious scholar of the philosophy and/or ethics of sport.\n\nNumber of pages: 472\n\nISBN13: 9780415829809\n\nISBN10: 0415829801\n\nFormat: PDF &amp; EPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d18e33f41eec633f40c0b90d5416c1215b59f7","amp;dn":"Routledge+Handbook+of+the+Philosophy+of+Sport+%5BPDF+%2B+EPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d18e33f41eec633f40c0b90d5416c1215b59f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,209,142,51,244,30,236,99,63,64,192,185,13,84,22,193,33,91,89,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
