And there was so much coming its kinda overwhelming to look back.  \nSome were fooled by the Hair Metal clones.\n\nBut they were all of one same beat. and they did not have a pit worth gettin into. \nI remember being in a Iron Maiden/Fastway and Saxon show pit. I dont know how I made it out everybody wore leathers and spikes and those fuckin things on the forearms\nit was covered with spikes and studs and blood! And that shit was not costume jewelery.\nThat thing could end ya.\nGoing into a good pit back then was like going into the coliseum but not the Oakland Alameda Co. one. more like the one that Russell Crowe was the champion in! But I survived it, I had to I was not gonna miss what was coming. \nBut thats down the road a bit. \nWe are at the beginning of the 80's Reagan was coming in and Georgia regained its most famous peanut farmer.
