He deliberately sings off-key and often high-pitched, so has a recognisable voice. His on-stage energy, and crowd surfing, hoisted and hauled up on garden chairs, are major features of the band's live shows, which frequently end up in a complete mess, Didier Wampas singing among the audience, and a large part of the audience going onto the stage.  \n\nIn interviews, Didier Wampas often repeated that he earned approximately a quarter of his private incomes from his activity as a singer, and the rest from his job as a mechanic at the RATP (public transportation service in Paris), which he kept in spite of the increasing fame and success of the band - until he retired in 2012. He frequently asserts his opposition to the French system of giving grants to professionals in the performing arts Ã¢â‚¬â€ this attitude is remarkable in the French culture.\n\nIn October 2011 Didier Wampas released his first solo album entitled &quot;Taisez moi&quot; (Silence me) which was recorded in Los Angeles and Brussels with musicians Ryan Ross (Ex Panic! at the Disco), Nick Johns and Kevin Harp. The album included the songs &quot;Chanteur de droite&quot; (A defense of the French right-wing singer Michel Sardou) and &quot;Karmann&quot;; a tribute to deceased ex-guitarist Marc Police. In May 2012 he announced his retirement from the RATP on French TV.\n\nIn January 2013 Didier began recording his second solo album entitled Comme dans un garage (Like in a garage) at Toerag Studios in London with the Bikini Machine. It was released in April 2013 credited to &quot;Didier Wampas &amp; Bikini Machine&quot;.\n\nIn 2013 he started yet another project, Sugar &amp; Tiger, consisting of his fiancÃƒÂ© (Vocals), himself on guitar and back vocals, his two sons on drums and guitar, and Jean-Mi Lejoux on bass.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeceff1526080429a2450d70dd3105ab43ae6211","amp;dn":"Didier+Wampas+-+Solo+Works+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeceff1526080429a2450d70dd3105ab43ae6211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,206,255,21,38,8,4,41,162,69,13,112,221,49,5,171,67,174,98,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
