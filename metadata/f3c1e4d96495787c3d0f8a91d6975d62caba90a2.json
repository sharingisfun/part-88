Inspired by the experience, Matt makes his famous liquid-centered chocolate cake and custard. Then, Matt and Alex drive out to Manjimup where they are taken on a tour to find some truffles. On the way back, they stop at the Melting Pot Glass workshop where they meet renowned glassmaker Gerry Reilly. Their next meeting is with another bass player-turned-farmer, Dave Carter. Dave is a potato farmer and his selection of freshly dug spuds inspires Matt to make an aromatic potato, lobster and truffle salad, while Alex makes his famous 'Spudsworth' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a crunchy-skinned freshly baked potato and a gooey, gloopy cheese sauce Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the ideal snack for school kids arriving home.\n\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 27-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c1e4d96495787c3d0f8a91d6975d62caba90a2","amp;dn":"Recipes.That.Rock.S01E02.HDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c1e4d96495787c3d0f8a91d6975d62caba90a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,193,228,217,100,149,120,124,61,15,138,145,214,151,93,98,202,186,144,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
