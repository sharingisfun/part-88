It is based upon the popular anime and manga series Case Closed by Gosho Aoyama. Players use the Wii Remote to find clues and solve the cases.Characters are designed in 3D models. During gameplay, the Wii Remote is used to solve cases in a point and click fashion (similar to games like Sam and Max and the Monkey Island series). There are times when Conan may be controlled as an actual character. There is an arcade mode where Conan travels around in an arcade where the players are able to play minigames.\n\n\nThis torrent contains a Nintendo Wii Game in WBFS format, which is actually just a compressed ISO image. It is important to note that your Wii reads this file directly from a hard drive (there is really no need to convert it). However, this game can easily be converted back to a full-size ISO faster than it takes to extract a ZIP file using either of these programs for Windows or Mac:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiibafu.codeplex.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiibafu.codeplex.com/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6216909&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6216909&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo play the Wii games after transferring them to an external hard drive, you will need what is called a USB loader of some sort. It is important to note that some USB Loaders can read games from an NTFS or FAT32 partition (just copy the WBFS file to the main root of the device), but there are limitations to each of these and you will generally have more success formatting to WBFS.\n\nYou can use one of these USB loaders to play your games, just follow the instructions located on the site to install it via The Homebrew Channel (basically put any Homebrew program in a folder called &quot;apps&quot; on the root of your SD card and make sure the DOL file is named &quot;boot.dol&quot;):\n\n\nUSB Loader GX:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://usbloadergx.koureio.net/downloads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://usbloadergx.koureio.net/downloads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nConfigurable USB Loader:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiiCoverFlow (aka CoverFloader):\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://code.google.com/p/wiicoverflow/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://code.google.com/p/wiicoverflow/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiiFlow:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wiiflow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wiiflow.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUSB Loader MRC:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=211423&amp;st=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=211423&amp;st=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNeoGamma:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=158884&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=158884&lt;/a&gt;\n\nuLoader by Hermes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8414a4c38b76c323ce662c2de447b74963c666da","amp;dn":"Case+Closed+-+The+Mirapolis+Investigation+%5BWBFS%5D+%28RCOPNP%29+%7BPAL%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8414a4c38b76c323ce662c2de447b74963c666da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,20,164,195,139,118,195,35,206,102,44,45,228,71,183,73,99,198,102,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
