With this game, Electronic Arts introduces the series to the world of the modern consoles (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). There is also the PC version available. Initially, the plan was to release Medal of Honor: Airborne for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but eventually it was abandoned.\nYet again we are taken to the turbulent period of World War II, and this time we take part in this conflict as a paratrooper. We assume the role of an American soldier, Boyd Travers of 82th Airborne Division. Each of the six campaigns begins on board of a transport plane, and we actively participate in the drop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on command, we jump out of the machine, fall freely, open the parachute, and finally land. It is worth noting that it depends virtually only on our decision where we will start the exploration of the battlefield. All missions are located in the area of the European continent such as Sicily, Normandy, Holland, and Germany (years 1943-1945).\nDuring the fight with the enemy soldiers, we have a range of authentic weapons at our disposal, and if a particular one is used often enough, there is no problem with improving it (e.g. Thompson submachine gun can be equipped with a roomier magazine reel, extra foregrip which improves accuracy when using continuous fire etc .). Medal of Honor: Airborne is powered by the popular Unreal Engine 3. The developers also used advanced U-cap and E-cap systems to create realistic animations. The whole is complemented by the multiplayer mode for up to twelve players, offering, among others, cooperation mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b810e4a69432e41973d759b5d87d8032d3b9b2","amp;dn":"Medal.of.Honor.Airborne.Repack-R.G.Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b810e4a69432e41973d759b5d87d8032d3b9b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,184,16,228,166,148,50,228,25,115,215,89,181,216,125,128,50,211,185,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
