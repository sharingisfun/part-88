Choose one.\nThen go into video config and adjust your resolution and brightness/gamma to taste.\nThat's all!\n\nThere are four graphics modes, which you can switch between via an external batch file ('High' is default):\n\nUltra - Recent medium-high-end machine and graphics card (2011 or later) recommended. Reflecting surfaces, bump-mapping, environmental effects, multiple particle effects, better flames, high-polyon models, effected reflecting water, ultra quality texturing.\nHigh - The default. For most modern machines. Geforce 7800 and dual-core 3ghz or better recommended. Environmental effects, multiple particle effects, better flames, high-polyon models, effected reflecting water, ultra quality texturing.\nMedium - For budget/medium spec computers and laptops with decent onboard 3d chipsets. Transparent water, high quality texturing, graphical options optimised for performance while still retaining a 'modern' feel.\nLow - Recommended for older machines. Also designed to be as similar to original quake as possible, for people who want a bit of nostalgia. Fewer/no shader effects, lower-quality texturing and uses less memory and cpu.\n\n\nMission pack 1\n\nRun the game:\nWindows: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 1.bat\nMac: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 1 - mac\nLinux: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 1 - linux\n\nMission pack 2\n\nRun the game:\nWindows: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 2.bat\nMac: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 2 - mac\nLinux: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 2 - linux\n\n\nMission pack 3\n\nRun the game:\nWindows: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 3.bat\nMac: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 3 - mac\nLinux: run (double-click) quake - mission pack 3 - linux","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfb4f78ae1a1a2d6b64931ed1f6f8b7b436e4315","amp;dn":"Quake+%2B+3+Dlc+%28Hd+Edition%29+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfb4f78ae1a1a2d6b64931ed1f6f8b7b436e4315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,180,247,138,225,161,162,214,182,73,49,237,31,111,139,123,67,110,67,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
