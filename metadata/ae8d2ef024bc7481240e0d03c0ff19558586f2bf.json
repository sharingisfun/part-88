Proceed with caution...\n\n\nEpisode 201 &quot;Death By Space Rock&quot;: TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show begins with chat about CQÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new show, the LOS show last night at the compound, NY approving a minimum wage hike, SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s issues with their hike, the effects of getting a free lunch, and Anthony breaks down Andy (unfunny cunt) Kindler and his upcoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“State of the IndustryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speech. We then hear some tunes by Sarah Silverman, talk about hypocrisy in comedy, look at some throwback bush and titties, Ant reads the latest drone news, a quick Anthony Weiner story, we see part of a Donald Trump interview with Anderson Cooper, Ant shares his thoughts on abortion and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“what ifsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that come along with it, and he discusses whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new all around the solar system. We see a bullet on bullet pic, discuss jizz and red wings, watch Ã¢â‚¬Å“Drinking out of Cups,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ do some investigation on Dan Deacon, and the show ends with a video of a horny bath salts gal and one of a Japanese fleshlight commercial.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae8d2ef024bc7481240e0d03c0ff19558586f2bf","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-07-23+Death+By+Space+Rock+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae8d2ef024bc7481240e0d03c0ff19558586f2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,141,46,240,36,188,116,129,36,14,13,3,192,255,25,85,133,134,242,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
