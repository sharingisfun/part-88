The special effects are laughable, and comic purists may find fault with certain story elements, but it's actually a decent movie.  Certainly not the best comic adaptation ever made, but it does harmonize well with the Incredible Hulk series also running on CBS during the same time frame. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94616a9fbffd48e8f07d728962e3ff9daef46738","amp;dn":"Marvel%27s+Dr.+Strange+TV+Pilot+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94616a9fbffd48e8f07d728962e3ff9daef46738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,97,106,159,191,253,72,232,240,125,114,137,98,227,255,157,174,244,103,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
