Village life is refreshingly simple and even in Vientiane itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe this sort of languid riverfront life exists in a national capital. Then, of course, there is the historic royal city of Luang Prabang, where watching as hundreds of saffron-robed monks move silently among centuries-old monaster-\nies is as romantic a scene as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll experience anywhere in Asia.\n\nAway from the cities, the rivers that wind dramatically down to the Mekong, the forested mountains of the north, the gothic limestone karsts of central Laos and the 4000 riverine islands of the deep south form one of the most intact ecosystems in Asia. Not surprisingly, this wilderness is drawing travellers looking for nature, adventure or both. Kayaking, rafting, rock-climbing and biking are all available, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the community-based trekking that is most popular because it combines spectacular natural attractions with the chance to experience the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœreal LaosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with a village homestay Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while spending your money where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needed most.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a growing tourist trail in Laos, but that just means thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of roads off Rte 13 where you can make your own trail. After all, half the fun of travelling here is in the travel itself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the people you meet, chickens you share seats with, wrong turns you take and lÃƒÂ o-lÃƒÂ¡o you drink with the smiling family at the end of the road less travelled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34ec182fd5c23a23a61a75e2f5e3b7c16f1a7bc","amp;dn":"Laos+-+Lonely+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34ec182fd5c23a23a61a75e2f5e3b7c16f1a7bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,78,193,130,253,92,35,162,58,97,167,94,47,94,59,124,22,241,167,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
