Utilising the help of P. Knight on vocals (and occasionally bass) located in the UK, 2005- early 2007 saw the recording of 2 demos and 2 split releases released in very limited numbers via different underground labels. These early releases explored more the idea of raw improvisation and experimenting with various self-recording techniques to achieve the final result.\n\nRecorded in Winter 2007, and originally planned as a 3rd demo, 2008 saw the emergence of what would become the debut full-length Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toward The DepthsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, released on CD, Vinyl and Tape in 2008/2009. This release was also the last of P. KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contribution to Woods of Desolation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Toward The DepthsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was subsequently re-released in 2012 on Digi CD/LP in limited editions via Northern Silence Productions.\n\nAutumn-Winter 2008 saw the writing &amp; recording of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“SorhÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP (meaning Sorrow in Modern English) featuring Mitch/Desolate (Austere) on guest vocals. After some delay and problems, this was released worldwide in 2009 as a digi-sleeve MCD by the German based label Eisenwald limited to 1000 copies. A vinyl version was released in 2010 featuring a bonus exclusive vinyl only track.\n\nAfter the recording of Sorh, Woods of Desolation went on hold for some time as D. shifted focus onto finishing the Grey Waters EP release that had been planned since 2006.\n\nHowever, D. re-commenced work again and 2009 was spent writing for what would become the 2nd full-length album. Desolate could no longer participate further in Woods of Desolation due to other commitments, but was soon temporarily replaced by Tim/Sorrow ( Austere/Grey Waters) on vocals, with him also taking over the drumming position from D. With this line-up D. entered the studio in late February 2010 and recorded the 2nd full-length album, titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Torn Beyond ReasonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, released February 25th 2011 through Northern Silence Productions on CD/DIGI CD/LP.\n\nAfter a couple of years of slowly writing and developing material, March 2013 saw the beginning of recording for the 3rd full-length album entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“As The StarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Alongside new session members (including Vlad of Drudkh/Old Silver Key on drums) the process wrapped up in October 2013 and a release date for CD/LP set is currently set for February 2014!\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nD.
