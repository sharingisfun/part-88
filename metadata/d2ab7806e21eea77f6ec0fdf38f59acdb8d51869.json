The debut feature by writer/director Daniel J. Harris, this dark satire follows five desperate hucksters to Las Vegas for a convention of salesmen hawking family Bibles and high-powered weapons door-to-door.[/B]\n\n[b]&quot;May Contain Spoilers&quot;[/b]\nLike seemingly everything in the '90s, the film is a nostalgic rehash of another decade, in this case the late '60s. The story takes place in the present, but the look of the film is filtered through what critic Amy Taubin calls &quot;the image bank future-past.&quot; Shot in black and white with a low-profile, hand-held camera, the film is so authentically retro--with black suits, skinny ties, repo-man cars and redneck attitudes--that it begs the question: why not watch the real thing?\n\nA film this minimalist and so human-scaled lives or dies on the strength of the dialogue and performances. And Harris's ear for ordinary bullshitting is perfectly served by this cast of superb character actors. There's Bill (Al Shuermann), the hard-assed head of the local chapter. Stan (Andy Kallok) is the hapless sad sack, having paranoid flashes about the growth he discovers on his neck. Don Yanan stands out as Phil, the deranged ex-LAPD cop with a bleak outlook who delivers the funniest moments in a film that is not too concerned with sympathetic characters. &quot;Anything above cancer is good news,&quot; is Phil's spin on Stan's lump. Sidney (Robert Blumenthal) is an ex-rabbi who sees no conflict flogging the Bible as long as it's the Old Testament. And Julian Ott plays Mike, the boss's shiftless son-in-law, who has &quot;no aptitude for anything except professional golf.&quot; Plying their trade in the trailer parks north of Las Vaguest, these guys sell salvation to the missus while the man of the camper gets the whole Travis Bickle arsenal of weaponry pitched in the name of &quot;home defense.&quot; It's a funny, scathing indictment of American hypocrisy, but even in its death-of-the-American-dream theme the film is retro--said dream having kicked sometime in the early '70s. Still, this truly indie movie (it took two years to find a distributor) takes a wry, absurdist swipe at the commercialization of violence, religion and sex, and has some (dry) fun doing it.\n\nTo capture the banal details of these Willy Lomans' disappointed lives, Harris convincingly copies the direct-cinema style of '60s and '70s documentary. Given that it's almost impossible to rent the Maysles brothers' documentary Salesman (1969), which was the inspiration for this film, it's the next best thing. Blurring the line between its documentary inspiration and fiction, the film features some nervy scenes between the actors and the real inhabitants of trailer parks, who were told they would be filmed as part of a documentary on the salesmen. Two boys handling the guns declare no interest in the Bibles. &quot;Aren't you worried about your souls?&quot; Stan asks. &quot;Not yet,&quot; they shoot back.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/fcd4vr4rr/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club12a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/fcd4vr4rr/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club12a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/510s33d2f/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/510s33d2f/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/4qt9jqyg7/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/4qt9jqyg7/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/qr9m0dh47/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/qr9m0dh47/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/c9cesdpt3/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/c9cesdpt3/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/slmgi444n/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/slmgi444n/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/sznshpo87/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/sznshpo87/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/euhzfwf6v/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/euhzfwf6v/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/6dih4zahz/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s5.postimg.org/6dih4zahz/The_Bibleand_Gun_Club11.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTrailer here (Funny!)\nyoutube..../watch?v=0J_IOQ_6Y08 \n\n\nLets hope for a Dvd release someday :D\n\n\nIMDb &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122994/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122994/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy rip from a very rare Dvdr TvRip, ~~~~ by smegma from CO/SC ~~~~\n\nFile Name:..........
