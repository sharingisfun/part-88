Dependable; fierce; brilliant at her job; a rising star in the ranks. Everyone knows how Marnie fought to come back from the murder of her parents, but very few know what is going on below the surface. Because Marnie has secrets she won't share with anyone. \nBut then so does everyone. Certainly those in the women's shelter Marnie and Detective Sergeant Noah Jake visit on that fateful day. The day when they arrive to interview a resident, only to find one of the women's husbands, who shouldn't have been there, lying stabbed on the floor. \nAs Marnie and Noah investigate the crime further, events begin to spiral and the violence escalates. Everyone is keeping secrets, some for survival and some, they suspect, to disguise who they really are under their skin. \nNow, if Marnie is going to find the truth she will have to face her own demons head on. Because the time has come for secrets to be revealed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fccab2f6c2a66c223d67eb0a340ee2ec974a623","amp;dn":"Someone+Else%27s+Skin+-+Sarah+Hilary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fccab2f6c2a66c223d67eb0a340ee2ec974a623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,204,171,47,108,42,102,194,35,214,126,176,163,64,238,46,201,116,166,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
