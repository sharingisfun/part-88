Drawing upon the modern tango of Piazzolla with a touch of minimalism, this dynamic quartet of violin, accordion, vibes and bass is modern instrumental music at its creative best. At times upbeat and humorous, at times dark and moody, the music combines a soaring lyricism with interlocking counterpoint and complex rhythmic tapestries. Featuring guitar genius Marc Ribot in a supportive role on several tracks, this is one of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest scores. A remarkable listening experience from start to finish. \n\nPersonnel:\nShanir Ezra Blumenkranz: Bass\nRob Burger: Accordion\nMark Feldman: Violin\nKenny Wollesen: Vibraphone\nMarc Ribot: Guitar \n\n    &quot;The Treatment&quot; - 3:34\n    &quot;Romance&quot; - 5:10\n    &quot;Why Me?&quot; - 3:56\n    &quot;Family&quot; - 2:15\n    &quot;Marking Time&quot; - 4:53\n    &quot;Anxieties&quot; - 5:00\n    &quot;Freud's Rondo&quot; - 4:26\n    &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; - 6:55\n    &quot;Rush Hour&quot; - 3:47\n    &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; - 1:20\n    &quot;Uncertainty&quot; - 6:24\n    &quot;Happy Ending&quot; - 2:44\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691372978e846746b04b4e78823f440101f7ea3e","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+18+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691372978e846746b04b4e78823f440101f7ea3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,19,114,151,142,132,103,70,176,75,78,120,130,63,68,1,1,247,234,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
