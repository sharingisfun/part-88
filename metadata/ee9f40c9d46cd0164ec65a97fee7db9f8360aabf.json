It does look better on TV than a regular PC but the quality is still good.\n\nIf you actually have an Apple TV but your WiFi doesn't reach your living room here's what you could do :\n\nGet a cheap android smartphone ( mine's a $ 70 alcate), and switch on personal hotspot. This created a powerless Wifi that you can still connect with both the Apple TV and your laptop/other Apple product. This would allow you to airplay without problems. I don't really know how it works but I'm sure it does :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9f40c9d46cd0164ec65a97fee7db9f8360aabf","amp;dn":"8+mile+720+p+Blue+ray+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9f40c9d46cd0164ec65a97fee7db9f8360aabf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,159,64,201,212,108,208,22,78,198,90,151,254,231,219,159,131,96,170,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
