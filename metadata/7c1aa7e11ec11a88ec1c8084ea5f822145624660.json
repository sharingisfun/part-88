There are, though, certain prejudices (it is continually remarked how primitive irish culture of the seventh and eighth centuries was, which more recent scholarship belies) and when it comes to barbarian military leaders, a couple of huge mistakes are made. On page 52, it referred to the conquering Vandal general, Ricimer (of course Gaiseric was meant, Ricimer was a Sueve and did not really ever conquer). Then on page 56 it refers to &quot;Ricimer and his Visigoths&quot; in 589, clearly meaning Reccared. With the growth of interest in Late Antiquity you now have scholars who know the difference between these individuals, and do not just say &quot;well, it is all in there somewhere.&quot; But nonetheless this book will not terribly mislead the beginning student.\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1aa7e11ec11a88ec1c8084ea5f822145624660","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Europe+-+Dark+Ages+from+Theodoric+to+Charlemagne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1aa7e11ec11a88ec1c8084ea5f822145624660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,26,167,225,30,193,26,136,236,28,128,132,234,95,130,33,69,98,70,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
