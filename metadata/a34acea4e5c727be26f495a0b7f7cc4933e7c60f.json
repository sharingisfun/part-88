These biographies offer a variety of rich primary and secondary source material to support teaching to the standards. Using the graphics, students can activate prior knowledge--bridge what they already know with what they have yet to learn. Graphically illustrated biographies also teach inference skills, character development, dialogue, transitions, and drawing conclusions. Graphic biographies in the classroom provide an intervention with proven success for the struggling reader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34acea4e5c727be26f495a0b7f7cc4933e7c60f","amp;dn":"Marie+Curie+Graphic+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34acea4e5c727be26f495a0b7f7cc4933e7c60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,74,206,164,229,199,39,190,38,244,149,160,183,247,204,73,51,231,198,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
