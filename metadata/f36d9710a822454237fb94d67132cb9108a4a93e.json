The team continues their mission to fend off massive threats to the Wildstorm Universe. But they may find that the biggest threat of all lies on their home turf. After an incident involving the United States government that threatens to bring about the end of the world, The Authority decide that it's not enough to simply police their world. So they decide the only way to help the world is to take control of it, starting with the United States of America. Needless to say, there are forces that are not going to allow this to happen.\n\nContinues in The Authority: Revolution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f36d9710a822454237fb94d67132cb9108a4a93e","amp;dn":"The+Authority+v2+%28000+-+014%29+%282003+-+2004%29+%28DeadmanWade-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f36d9710a822454237fb94d67132cb9108a4a93e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,109,151,16,168,34,69,66,55,251,148,214,113,50,203,145,8,164,169,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
