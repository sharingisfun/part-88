(July 17th 2015) \n\n        This is a small update that addresses a number of issues reported\n        by users since the last release. It includes improvements,\n        changes and fixes to a number of features, including: \n\n        Ã‚Â· Fixed tokenization bug related to strtok()'s use of an internal\n          static varible. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed script error line number bug that was causing line number\n          not to be reported in some contexts. \n        Ã‚Â· Updated libraries to PCRE v8.37 and OpenSSL 1.0.1p. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed SSL certificate change warning bug that caused warnings\n          to be displayed for valid certificates. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed /filter output to nul not working. \n        Ã‚Â· Updated voice command support to work with newer versions of\n          Windows. \n        Ã‚Â· Extended /server to handle passwords with spaces. \n        Ã‚Â· Changed drag-drop to only set focus on a window once a file has\n          been dropped onto it. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed /play dialog not allowing long filenames to be typed into\n          filename editbox. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed file dialog bug that prevented typing a folder name into\n          the filename editbox to change into that folder. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed /exit bug that caused settings to be saved incorrectly\n          when used in some contexts. \n        Ã‚Â· Added $encode()/$decode() 'a' switch for base32 encoding. \n        Ã‚Â· Added $hmac(text|&amp;binvar|filename, key, hash, 0|1|2)\n          identifier. \n        Ã‚Â· Added $hotp(key, count, hash, digits) identifier. \n        Ã‚Â· Added support for IRCv3 message tags and $msgtags(tag|N)\n          identifier. \n        Ã‚Â· Added on PARSELINE event that allows scripts to modify\n          incoming/outgoing server messages. \n        Ã‚Â· Fixed Event Beeps beep value not being applied resulting in\n          repeated beeping during a flash event. \n        Ã‚Â· Other changes and bug fixes. \n\n\n        In total there have been around 30 changes since the last release\n        and although most of them are only small fixes and tweaks, we\n        hope that they result in a more useful and stable mIRC for you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2de48efedf424bbdf1efbf42d7e8ecd842a116","amp;dn":"MIRC+v7+42-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd2de48efedf424bbdf1efbf42d7e8ecd842a116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,45,228,142,254,223,66,75,189,241,239,191,66,215,232,236,216,66,161,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
