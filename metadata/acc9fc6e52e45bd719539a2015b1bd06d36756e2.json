Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - fixed PyLNP dfhack tab config\n     NB:  activation of a dfhack option in PyLNP overrides non-activation in LNP.\n          PyLNP thus defaults all dfhack options to deactivated.\n** updated DF to v0.40.13\n - no graphics updates required immediately\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to 26.0\n - updated DFHack to 40.13-r1\n - updated PyLNP to v0.5; fixes the issues raised since last pack\n - fixed CLA_text.png some more\n - updated Isoworld to v2.1; handles new export names\n - updated TwbT to v3.43 (prerelease but stable)\n\nMD5:  D1A8E45C1BBE2AD044B626032C54DA3C","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc9fc6e52e45bd719539a2015b1bd06d36756e2","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_13+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc9fc6e52e45bd719539a2015b1bd06d36756e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,201,252,110,82,228,91,215,25,83,154,32,21,177,189,6,211,103,86,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
