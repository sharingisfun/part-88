Griskey (Wiley, 2002).pdf\n\nISBN: 0471438197\n\nThe subject of transport phenomena has long been thoroughly and expertly addressed on the graduate and theoretical levels. Now Transport Phenomena and Unit Operations: A Combined Approach endeavors not only to introduce the fundamentals of the discipline to a broader, undergraduate-level audience but also to apply itself to the concerns of practicing engineers as they design, analyze, and construct industrial equipment.\nRichard Griskey's innovative text combines the often separated but intimately related disciplines of transport phenomena and unit operations into one cohesive treatment. While the latter was an academic precursor to the former, undergraduate students are often exposed to one at the expense of the other. Transport Phenomena and Unit Operations bridges the gap between theory and practice, with a focus on advancing the concept of the engineer as practitioner. Chapters in this comprehensive volume include:\n\nTransport Processes and Coefficients\nFrictional Flow in Conduits\nFree and Forced Convective Heat Transfer\nHeat Exchangers\nMass Transfer; Molecular Diffusion\nEquilibrium Staged Operations\nMechanical Separations\nEach chapter contains a set of comprehensive problem sets with real-world quantitative data, affording students the opportunity to test their knowledge in practical situations. Transport Phenomena and Unit Operations is an ideal text for undergraduate engineering students as well as for engineering professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f570d3f0f1cd367a19ba676833e8f991cd260f14","amp;dn":"Transport+Phenomena+and+Unit+Operations+-+A+Combined+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f570d3f0f1cd367a19ba676833e8f991cd260f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,112,211,240,241,205,54,122,25,186,103,104,51,232,249,145,205,38,15,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
