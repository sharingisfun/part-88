The dish is prized for the thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook.\n\nPreparing the dish is no mean feat. Strong lungs are needed to blow air into the uncooked duck until it is inflated, separating the skin from the meat. It also takes skill and experience to gut the duck through a tiny hole cut under its wing, so as to preserve its skin. After it is roasted, it takes practice in order to slice the duck into 100-120 even slices in 5 minutes, each slice with an even distribution of meat and skin.\n\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 21-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971a4af56ca972fbf8c2f111a4d59b171424ddd1","amp;dn":"Kung.Fu.Kitchen.S01E05.PDTV.x264-SammY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971a4af56ca972fbf8c2f111a4d59b171424ddd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,26,74,245,108,169,114,251,248,194,241,17,164,213,155,23,20,36,221,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
