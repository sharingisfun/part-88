While attending Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, he had a out-of-body experience during which he was transported into outer space. As biographer John Szwed records him saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“my whole body changed into something else. I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ While there, aliens with Ã¢â‚¬Å“little antenna on each ear. A little antenna on each eyeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instructed him to drop out of college and speak through his music. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just what he did, changing his name from Herman Blount and never looking back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86d3125cba8200a813a91e1326a7e45ab9646256","amp;dn":"Sun+Ra+-+lecture+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86d3125cba8200a813a91e1326a7e45ab9646256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,211,18,92,186,130,0,168,19,169,30,19,38,167,228,90,185,100,98,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
