The Developement have taken me around 1 year. \n\nI've been Developing the game under the name GoseTech \n\nThe Game Itself is Developed in C++ with SDL library. \nIt's a 2:D game &amp; it works without any bugs at all. \n\nStarted from Version 1.0 but have now Reached 2.0 wich is a Stable release and shuld be bugfree(The Game is well tested with over 2000 Downloads). \n\nThe Game \nYou controll a blue cube &amp; your Task is to obtain as much points as possible &amp; stay alive as long as possible to unlock new maps(lots of things can happen). \n\nWhile playing you can collect powerups(Speed, minimode, points) Speed increases your movement speed &amp; minimode makes your enemies smaller(easier to avoid). \n\nThe points Gives you + 10 each time you manage to take it. Tough if you manage to take it 3 times in a row(without missing it) the Multiplier increases and the pointsymbol(powerup) is now worth 2x the points. The multiplier can go up to max 3x. \n\nWhile playing you also obtain Upgradepoints. These Points can be spent in the shop to upgrade your cube in different ways(Speed 0/3, Minimode 0/1, Portals 0/1). \n\nWebiste &amp; The game \nThe Website has features as Topscores &amp; Player history. \nIf The players want to be on the Website the player/s only have to press 'F10' in the Game menu &amp; the score is Synced and uploaded on to my server. The score will be visible instant(Live) on the Website. \n\nAnti-cheat System \nWe will never get rid of cheaters. That's why i implemented an ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM into my Game. \n\nThe System Checks if the Files/Cache has been manipulated each time the game is launched &amp; exited. If manipulation is Detected The game will Reset the Player Score To Zero and Lock all the Maps. The Player will have to start all over again. \n\nPlease check http://crazycubes.co.nf for more information \n\n/ \nBest Regards \nMartin Oskarsson\nGoseTech","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9c6f12882ada7f4e75c458339a70e47d1a3042","amp;dn":"The+world%27s+Hardest+game+-+Crazy+Cubes+2.0+%5BSurvival+Game+WIth+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9c6f12882ada7f4e75c458339a70e47d1a3042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,156,111,18,136,42,218,127,78,117,196,88,51,154,112,228,125,26,48,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
