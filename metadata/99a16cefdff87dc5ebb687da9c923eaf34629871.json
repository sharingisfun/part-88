Topics include normed linear and Hilbert spaces, the Hahn-Banach theorem, the closed graph theorem, the open mapping theorem, linear operator theory, the spectral theory, and a brief introduction to the Lebesgue measure. The book explains the motivation for the development of these theories, and applications that illustrate the theories in action. Applications in optimal control theory, variational problems, wavelet analysis and dynamical systems are also highlighted. Ã¢â‚¬ËœA First Course in Functional AnalysisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will serve as a ready reference to students not only of mathematics, but also of allied subjects in applied mathematics, physics, statistics and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99a16cefdff87dc5ebb687da9c923eaf34629871","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Functional+Analysis%3A+Theory+and+Applications+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99a16cefdff87dc5ebb687da9c923eaf34629871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,161,108,239,223,248,125,197,235,182,135,218,156,146,62,175,52,98,152,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
