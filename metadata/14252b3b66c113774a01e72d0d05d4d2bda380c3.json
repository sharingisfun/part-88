With their power dwindling due to the absence of their leader, the remnants of Frieza's army are led by an alien named Sorbet, who decides to revive their master. He then sets off to Earth with one other minion, Tagoma, where they convince Emperor Pilaf, Mai, and Shu, who have collected the Dragon Balls to let them summon Shenron instead. As Shenron is unable to fully revive Frieza, he brings him back to life in pieces, and his minions put him together using their advanced technology. As soon as Frieza's body is regenerated, he emerges in his first form and announces to his soldiers that he will not be satisfied until Goku and Future Trunks have both been killed. Tagoma suggests to Frieza that he should just ignore Goku and the other Saiyans. Frieza, irritated, kills Tagoma with a quick Ki blast. Sorbet informs Frieza that they haven't been able to locate Future Trunks in all this time and that Goku's power has surpassed that of even Majin Buu, which is far more than Frieza could have ever imagined. But due to him being a prodigy, Frieza states that through several months of serious training, he will be able to unlock his dormant power and would be able to wipe out the Saiyans in the blink of an eye","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14252b3b66c113774a01e72d0d05d4d2bda380c3","amp;dn":"DragonBall+Z+Ressurrection+of+F+English+Full+Movie+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14252b3b66c113774a01e72d0d05d4d2bda380c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,37,43,59,102,193,19,119,74,1,231,45,13,5,212,210,189,163,128,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
