Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' is the second film personally supervised by the series creator himself, Akira Toriyama. The new movie showcases the return of Frieza - one of the most iconic villains of all time. Even the complete obliteration of his physical form can't stop the galaxy's most evil overlord. After years in spiritual purgatory, Frieza has been resurrected and plans to take his revenge on the Z-Fighters of Earth. Facing off against Frieza's powerful new form, and his army of 1,000 soldiers, Goku and Vegeta must reach new levels of strength in order to protect Earth from their vengeful nemesis.\n\n\nPlot\nOne peaceful day on Earth, two remnants of Frieza's army named Sorbet and Tagoma arrive searching for the Dragon Balls with the aim of reviving Frieza. They succeed, and Frieza subsequently seeks revenge on the Saiyans. With their power dwindling due to the absence of their leader, the remnants of Freeza's army are led by an alien named Sorbet (Ã£â€šÂ½Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â„¢ Sorube?), who decides to revive their master. He then sets off to Earth with one other minion, Tagoma (Ã£â€šÂ¿Ã£â€šÂ´Ã£Æ’Å¾ Tagoma?), where they convince Pilaf, Mai, and Shu, who have collected the Dragon Balls to let them summon Shenlong instead. As Shenlong is unable to fully revive Freeza, he brings him back to life in pieces, and his minions put him together using their advanced technology. Once restored, Freeza kills Tagoma and learns that Son Goku got much stronger, to the point of defeating Majin Boo and thus, he decides he too needs to become more powerful. Freeza reveals that, since his power was inborn, he had never trained a day in his life, and so he trains himself for the first time, before returning to Earth with his army six months later. Jaco the Galactic Patrolman travels to earth to warn Bulma that Freeza is approaching, and she gathers the other warriors to fight him. With Goku and Vegeta training on Planet Beerus with Whis, unaware that Freeza has been revived, Son Gohan, Piccolo, Kuririn, Kame-Sennin, Tenshinhan and Jaco fight off Freeza's soldiers.\n\nBulma's message eventually reaches Whis, and Goku and Vegeta travel back to Earth to fight Freeza. Whis and Beerus join them in order to eat a strawberry-flavored dessert Bulma has prepared for them. Goku fights Freeza first by transforming into the blue-haired Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Ã¨Â¶â€¦Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂµÃ£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ£â€šÂ´Ã£Æ’Æ’Ã£Æ’â€°SSÃ£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€˜Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂµÃ£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂº SÃ…Â«pÃ„ï¿½ Saiya-jin Goddo SÃ…Â«pÃ„ï¿½ Saiya-jin?), and Freeza transforms into a new &quot;Golden Freeza&quot; (Ã£â€šÂ´Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â«Ã£Æ’â€¡Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’â€¢Ã£Æ’ÂªÃ£Æ’Â¼Ã£â€šÂ¶ GÃ…ï¿½ruden FurÃ„Â«za?) form. Goku ultimately gains the upper hand, but he is shot in the chest by Sorbet. Freeza stands over the incapacitated Goku and offers Vegeta a chance to kill Goku for him in exchange for his own life. Vegeta refuses and transforms into the blue-haired Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form as well, much to Freeza's shock. Vegeta tells Kuririn to revive Goku with a Senzu bean. As the latter moves to do so, Freeza attacks him, but Vegeta intercepts and deflects Freeza's blast towards Sorbet, killing him. Vegeta attacks Freeza, eventually causing him to revert back to his base form, who then realizes that he cannot win. Freeza decides to destroy the planet, killing Vegeta in the process. Shortly afterwards, Earth is destroyed, but Whis creates a bubble around a small piece of rock to protect himself and the others. While Bulma despairs, Goku regrets not killing Freeza when he had the chance. Whis tells him that he has the power to set back time but only three minutes earlier. He does so, and they arrive back right before Freeza destroys the Earth. Goku immediately attacks with a Kamehameha and kills Freeza.\n\nAs the characters say their goodbyes to Beerus and Whis, Goku and Vegeta discuss Whis's assertion that, if the two of them were to team up they would be powerful enough to beat even Beerus. Vegeta states that although this may be true, he still prefers to fight alone in order to test his own abilities and become the greatest fighter on his own. Surprisingly, Goku agrees with him and the two share a laugh over having finally found something they agree on.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Freeza returns to hell and is welcomed back by dancing happy angels of hell, much to his dismay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:174cb245fbbb15eeea6a3f03b095addb84589830","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z+Revival+of+F+%282015%29+Full+Movie+English+Dub+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"174cb245fbbb15eeea6a3f03b095addb84589830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,76,178,69,251,187,21,238,234,106,63,3,176,149,173,219,132,88,152,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
