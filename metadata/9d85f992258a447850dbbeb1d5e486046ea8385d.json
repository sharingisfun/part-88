With unprecedented access to both smugglers and law enforcement agencies, this is a unique insight into the global war on drugs.\n\nIn August 2013 Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum were jailed for six years and eight months each for trying to smuggle 1.5 million pounds worth of cocaine from Peru to Spain. Their arrest highlighted that Peru has taken over from Colombia as the cocaine capital of the world.\n\nThis remarkable documentary has secured unprecedent access to every link in the drugs chain across Peru. In the film, the gangs who are sending the mules speak on camera; from those who groom them to those who make the bags for transportation.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/29/c479bbde5e8f5056aa655a2cd974aab2.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/29/b43108352075a6989c3196526adc347f.jpg[/img]\n\nAround 50% of the cocaine found in the UK originates in Peru. And it is primarily young European women who are acting as the mules. Stopping the Peruvian drug traffickers has now become a priority for the British government, as every day, huge quantities of the drug are carried across international borders.
