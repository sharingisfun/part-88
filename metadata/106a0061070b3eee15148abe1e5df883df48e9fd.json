I thought others who enjoyed Paul Kossoff's playing might find it interesting. It is a talk given by Paul's father, actor David Kossoff, after his son's death from a heart attack at 25, associated with his drug use. David presented this performance to groups of schoolchildren to warn them of the dangers that come with the use of drugs, in a campaign he kept up until his death in 2005. Plese don't complain about the quality of the original recording, I know it's not perfect. Just be entertained by the content. I'm happy to be given advice about anything to do with cleaning up the original, or my lack of uploading skills.
