This installment presents a charming and lyrical score created for renowned Russian animator Dimitri GellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delightful animated parable The Rain Horse. Beautifully performed by the dynamic trio of Erik Friedlander, Rob Burger and Greg Cohen, these eleven cues are some of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most appealing music for film. Passionate and poignant chamber music for another masterpiece by one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great animators . \n\nPersonnel:\nRob Burger: Piano\nGreg Cohen: Bass\nErik Friedlander: Cello \n\n    &quot;Tears of Morning&quot; - 4:32\n    &quot;The Stallion&quot; - 2:42\n    &quot;Tree of Life&quot; - 3:01\n    &quot;Wedding of Wild Horses&quot; - 4:21\n    &quot;Forests in the Mist&quot; - 6:09\n    &quot;Dance Exotique&quot; - 2:59\n    &quot;Bird in the Mist&quot; - 4:01\n    &quot;Parable of Job&quot; - 4:17\n    &quot;Encounter&quot; - 2:10\n    &quot;The Rain Horse&quot; - 4:16\n    &quot;End Credits&quot; - 2:04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f75342251f767604d6fa93def9955e82f61393b","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+19+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f75342251f767604d6fa93def9955e82f61393b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,117,52,34,81,247,103,96,77,111,169,61,239,153,85,232,47,97,57,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
