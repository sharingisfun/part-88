The title was produced by French studio Ivory Tower, founded by former employees of Eden Games (responsible for the series of Test Drive Unlimited) with the support team developer, Ubisoft Reflections.\nAs befits a racing game, the players have the opportunity to assume the roles of drivers and try their hand at exciting race through the streets of American cities. The developers took care of a wide selection of cars available, many of which are licensed models of leading manufacturers. In total, the game offers more than a hundred carefully mapped cars in five diverse categories.\nThe developersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ambition was, just like the promotional slogan said, to make sure that the players never raced alone, thus the emphasis on the presence of extensive social features, allowing a smooth transition between single and multiplayer modes. The Crew offers a bunch of modes for, inter alia, individual competition, or team competition with oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends or randomly chosen players. One of the key features of the game is an open world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the creators prepared nearly 5,000 square miles of land located in the United States, intended for exploration, filled with a variety of attractions: hundreds of missions, races, and tasks. The role-playing campaign offers about 10 hours of gameplay during which the players participate in history of six different characters.\nOne of the most characteristic elements of the game is an extensive system of car modifying. The players can make a number of changes not only in the appearance of the body, but also in the technical parameters, adapting the vehicle to individual tastes and preferred driving style. The possibility of creating your own vehicle using parts acquired during the game is also an interesting options. The developers tried to accommodate both the inexperienced players and the lovers of simulation-style gameplay with different driving models.\nThe Crew is characterized by a high-quality graphics and sound. Carefully mapped car models and varied route surroundings where battles between drivers take place also attract attention","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f271bb0ba8f02a16aa08e917023ce519aee01bbe","amp;dn":"The+Crew.Repack-R.G.Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f271bb0ba8f02a16aa08e917023ce519aee01bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,113,187,11,168,240,42,22,170,8,233,23,2,60,229,25,174,224,27,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
