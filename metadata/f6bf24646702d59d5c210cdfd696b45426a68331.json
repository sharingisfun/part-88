His family was so poor that as a child he helped deliver his \n\nsiblings as his parents could not afford a midwife.\nDepardieu writes he began to wander the streets when he was just 10 but could easily pass \n\nfor being 15 - and quickly realised he was attractive to men.\nHe said: 'I've known since I was very young that I please homosexuals' and added when men \n\napproached, asking for sex, 'I would ask them for money'.\nHe also admits he occasionally helped a man to dig up newly buried bodies in the cemetery \n\nand steal jewellery and shoes from them.\n\nAt 16, he served three weeks in prison for stealing a car but continued his career as a \n\nrent boy after moving from ChÃƒÂ¢teauroux, in central France, where he grew up, to Paris. \n\nOccasionally he would mug his clients.\n'At 20, the thug in me was alive and kicking,' he writes.\n'I would rip some of them off. I would beat up some bloke and leave with all his money.'\n\nHe also describes stealing watches and money from students taking part in the May 1968 \n\nanti-government protests, picking their pockets as they slept on the street in between \n\nskirmishes with police.\nAt one point he also routinely charmed his way into a Nato base where he bought cigarettes \n\nto sell for twice what he had paid.\nDescribing himself as a 'rough-hewn peasant' he eventually married actress Elisabeth \n\nGuignot, who is from a well-off Parisian family and they had two children, Guillaume and \n\nJulie. He had two more with two other women: but family life and the role of father is not \n\none that Depardieu plays well.\nWhen his children have complained about being associated with him he writes he has told \n\nthem: 'What do you want? Change your name, for heaven's sake, if it bothers you.'\nThe confessions of the Cyrano de Bergerac star also shed new light on the tragic life of \n\nGuillaume who was also an actor. He also admitted to working as a rent boy when he was \n\nbroke and he served two prison sentences for theft and drugs. He died of viral pneumonia \n\nin 2008, aged 37.\n\nDepardieu blames his inability to tell his children he loved them on his father Dede, a \n\nmetalworker and volunteer fireman who said very little. 'I could never find the words,' he \n\nwrites. 'I know how to speak the words of others, but when it comes to my own, I am the \n\nson of DÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©.'\nDepardieu, a drinker and gourmet, is well known for rumbustious behaviour. He has crashed \n\nhis scooter when drunk, attacked photographers and outraged fellow aircraft passengers by \n\nurinating in the aisle.\nThe actor recently boasted of drinking 14 bottles a day, starting with champagne in the \n\nmorning and ending with whisky at night. He claims his drinking is not a sign he is an \n\nalcoholic but a man hounded by phobias: 'I'm obsessed with the racket in my body, the \n\nbeating of my heart, the gurgling of my intestines, my joints cracking,' he writes.\n'It's become a phobia to the point that if I'm alone in a hotel I must drink so as not to \n\nhear it, so as not to go mad from it. I can't get to sleep unless I am dead drunk.'\nHe has little patience for the Socialist government of President FranÃƒÂ§ois Hollande whom he \n\nblamed for leaving France in a 'filthy mess'. He fled the country last year for Belgium \n\nand Russia, where he became a citizen, to avoid paying what he said was an 87% tax bill.\n'Are you happy now?' he claims to have bellowed down the phone at Hollande after telling \n\nhim he was leaving.\nDepardieu also tells of his friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. They \n\nfirst met in 2008 and immediately hit it off, recognising they had much in common.\n'We could have both become hoodlums,' he writes. 'I think he immediately liked my hooligan \n\nside ... the fact that I had occasionally been picked up off the pavement dead drunk.\n'Like with me, nobody would have betted a penny on him when he was 15.'\nDepardieu reveals he regularly writes to Putin: 'It's very easy', he explains, 'I speak, \n\nthere's a guy who taps it out in French then translates it into Russian and it arrives on \n\nPutin's desk. I send him letters that tell him about everything. He's like an old chum. It \n\namuses him and he replies.'\n\nFilms Included In This Torrent\n\nAu rendez-vous de la mort joyeuse\nBetween Strangers\nCadences obstinÃƒÂ©es\nCoco\nEttore.Scola.Concorrenza.Sleale\nGrenouille_d'hiver\nInspecteur.La.Bavure\nJe prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ¨re qu'on reste amis\nKlara.Lu4ko.Pozdny.Lubov\nl_inconnu\nLa Femme Du Gange\nla_pomme_de_son_oeil\nLa_scoumoune\nL'Affaire Dominici\nL'An 01\nLe Sucre\nLe Tueur\nLe viager\nLe.Grand.Frere\nle_cyborg_ou_le_voyage_vertical\nLes Anges Gardiens\nLes cent et une nuits de Simon Cinema\nLes Chiens\nLes.Enfants.de.Timpelbach\nles_aventures_de_zadig\nMaigret - Mon ami Maigret\nMirka\nPas si mÃƒÂ©chant que ÃƒÂ§a\nRasputin\nRendez-vous ÃƒÂ  Badenberg\nRenÃƒÂ© la canne\nRosy la bourrasque\nRuy_Blas\nSept Morts Sur Ordonnance\nSex, kofe, sigarety\nStreghe verso nord\nTurf\nTutto L'Amore Che C'ÃƒÂ¨\nUn jour un destin Gerard Depardieu\nun_monsieur_bien_range\nUna pura formalita\nUne Femme Ou Deux\nVincent.Francois.Paul.Et.Les.Autres\nVse.mogut.koroli\nVulpone\nXXL\nZavist.Bogov\nZaytsev\n\nTHE GERARD DEPARDIEU COLLECTION PART 4 COMING SOON.. \n\nTHE GERARD DEPARDIEU COLLECTION PART 1 DOWNLOAD LINK \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/8386283/Gerard_Depardieu_Collection_Part_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/8386283/Gerard_Depardieu_Collection_Part_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHE GERARD DEPARDIEU COLLECT ION PART 2 LINK HERE\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/12216265/THE_GERARD_DEPARDIEU_COLLECTION_PART_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.gd/torrent/12216265/THE_GERARD_DEPARDIEU_COLLECTION_PART_2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6bf24646702d59d5c210cdfd696b45426a68331","amp;dn":"THE+GERARD+DEPARDIEU+COLLECTION+PART+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6bf24646702d59d5c210cdfd696b45426a68331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,191,36,100,103,2,213,157,92,33,12,223,214,150,180,84,38,166,131,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
