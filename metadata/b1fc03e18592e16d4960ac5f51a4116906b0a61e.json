(guitars) and J.S.G (drums) left their previous band and decided to form a new one. A few weeks later, E.B. joined the band as vocalist and bassist. R.M. later joined the band as second guitarist.\n\nThe founding members agreed on one thing when they formed the band: the band's sound was going to be a mix between different styles of dark and extreme music, but its roots would have to be firmly planted in the &quot;dark death metal&quot; style with an old-school approach yet incorporating a lot of elements from other dark styles of music such as doom metal, black metal and ambient. Phobocosm's music is comprised of an even mix of slow, mid-paced and fast parts with a strong focus on writing the darkest riffs possible in the realm of death metal.\n\nEach band member brings his own influences into the mix to make the band's music as dark, atypical and original as possible. Influences include Immolation, Dead Congregation, Deathspell Omega, The Axis Of Perdition, Arkhon Infaustus, Hate Eternal, Incantation, Evoken, Ulcerate and Neurosis among others.\n\nPhobocosm have signed with Dark Descent to release their debut album &quot;Deprived&quot; on September 30, 2014. The 8-song, 48-minute opus was mixed and mastered by Colin Marston (Gorguts, Dysrhythmia, Krallice).\nFile Name \tSize\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 08 Forever in Doubt.mp3 \t25.73 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 06 Drowned.mp3 \t15.18 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 03 Knives in the Senate House.mp3 \t14.71 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 04 Solar Storm.mp3 \t14.26 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 07 Awaken Unconscious.mp3 \t11.63 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 05 27 Days of Darkness.mp3 \t11.24 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 02 Solipsist.mp3 \t10.05 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - phobocosm_promo_picture_black_and_white.jpg \t9.62 MB\nPhobocosm - Deprived - 01 Sleep Deprivation.mp3 \t7.82 MB\ncover.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1fc03e18592e16d4960ac5f51a4116906b0a61e","amp;dn":"Phobocosm+-+Deprived++mp3++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1fc03e18592e16d4960ac5f51a4116906b0a61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,252,3,225,133,146,225,109,73,96,172,95,81,164,17,105,6,176,166,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
