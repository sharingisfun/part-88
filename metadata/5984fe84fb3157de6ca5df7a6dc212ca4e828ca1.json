We watch a throwback To Catch a Predator video, review a couple of new submissions for the &quot;unblock promotion,&quot; see a clip regarding &quot;The Un-Civil War: BLACKS vs NIGGERS&quot; and then, the author of the book Taleeb Starkes joins Ant in studio. They discuss subcultures and conditions in the black community, how victims are treated differently because of agendas, black leaders, entitlement and opportunity, and how research was done for the book. They watch a video of a shooting in the Bronx, talk about statistics and solutions, and then the ever wonderful callers chime in once again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5984fe84fb3157de6ca5df7a6dc212ca4e828ca1","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-18+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5984fe84fb3157de6ca5df7a6dc212ca4e828ca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,132,254,132,251,49,87,222,108,165,223,122,109,194,18,202,78,130,140,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
