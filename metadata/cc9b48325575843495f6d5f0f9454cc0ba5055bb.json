It was released just weeks before Randy CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic death.  The album was a compromise of sorts.  It originally began as an out and out blues album, but then pop material and various bonus tracks and multiple overdubs were thrown into the mix at the last minute making it a little uneven.\n\nCalifornia Blues Redux, revisits the project, but with aim of re- presenting a rawer blues-edged album.   All the tracks used for this new version are superior remixes or alternate takes, and all have been remastered.  The original non-blues bonus tracks have been removed and replaced with more appropriate material, such as the delicate instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“David,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the haunting slide-driven Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kind and Gentle LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a couple of impromptu jams between California and Matt Andes.  The lone live track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red HouseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been removed in favor of the unreleased Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stone Lover.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  As a bonus for fans there is a second live disc from shows in 1995 and 1996 which focuses on the blues material and highlights RandyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s improvisational skills with some lengthy exploratory jams , such as the 18 minute version of &quot;Love from Here&quot; and the 16 minute medley of &quot;Fixing to Die, Gopal and Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.  These two discs highlight the fact that Randy was at the top of his game in 1996 writing great material and making great music.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9b48325575843495f6d5f0f9454cc0ba5055bb","amp;dn":"Spirit+-+California+Blues+-+Redux+%281996%3B+2009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9b48325575843495f6d5f0f9454cc0ba5055bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,155,72,50,85,117,132,52,149,246,213,240,249,69,76,192,186,80,85,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
