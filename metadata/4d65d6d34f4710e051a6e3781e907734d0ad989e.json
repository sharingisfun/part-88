Gomez, Dave Smith\n\nEpisode 203: Today we start with Anthony discussing Reggie JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“profaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ video and the apology that came out of it, picture and autograph hounds, Jimmy and all of his celebrity pics, Donald Trump Ã¢â‚¬Å“rapingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ivana, and predictions of this presidential debate being the highest rated ever. Out at the table, Luis J. Gomez and Dave Smith sit with Ant to air out a few gripes, they talk about dildos, shrinkage, gay fantasies, gynecologists, hemorrhoids, and Ari ShaffirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s butthole. The callers chime in with their thoughts on dicks and doctors, the guys give medical advice, talk about fingers in the ass, reminisce about taking virginities, caller Ã¢â‚¬Å“MikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells a long and drawn out story, the guys discuss food workers in the city, fucking randos, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“getting back in the game.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ant reads off some audience gripes, they chat about John Cena being a beast, broken noses, Joe DeRosa, Gavin McInnes, father figures, race and generalizations, language policing yourself, compromising who you are, major mishaps in past presidents, the things Ant learned from his dad, LouisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dead dad, and the guys talk about Ã¢â‚¬Å“what-ifsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and how they affect lives. They then get into doxxing, Dan Soder, getting shit talked on-line, Big JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roast, appreciating the good things, fans misplacing anger, and wrap up in overtime talking about Andy Kindler, counterbalancing success, a reporter that was kicked out of a rally, hypocrisy in playing the victim, perpetuating racism, owning your past, the tranny kid story from yesterday, and varying psychological issues and defects.\n\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d65d6d34f4710e051a6e3781e907734d0ad989e","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-07-28+Luis+J.+Gomez%2C+Dave+Smith+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d65d6d34f4710e051a6e3781e907734d0ad989e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,101,214,211,79,71,16,224,81,166,227,120,30,144,119,52,208,173,152,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
