Metaphysics covers the gamut of historical and contemporary arguments of metaphysics, engaging readers through three profound questions: What are the most general features of the world? Why is there a world? And, what is the place of human beings in the world?\n\nThe thoroughly revised fourth edition includes an updated and rewritten chapter on temporality and significant improvements to the clarity and accessibility of the language, making it an even more valuable text for undergraduate students. Metaphysics remains the quintessential book in this field of study, and a fascinating book for a wide range of readers, from those new to the subject to the most sophisticated philosophers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925ee0f06859dfdaaa3948ef8492a0ec11fb512b","amp;dn":"Peter+van+Inwagen+-+Metaphysics+%284th+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925ee0f06859dfdaaa3948ef8492a0ec11fb512b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,94,224,240,104,89,223,218,170,57,72,239,132,146,160,236,17,251,81,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
