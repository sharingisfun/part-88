Smart Vertical Gardening for Small and Large Spaces by Susan Morrison, Rebecca Sweet\n\nOverview: Filled with design tips, plant ideas and over 200 photos, Garden Up! offers inspiration and how-to information for enhancing any outdoor space with vertical elements. Authors Morrison and Sweet cover everything from living wall projects simple enough for a home gardener to tackle to creative solutions for blank walls and narrow beds.\n\nIn chapters like 'Arbors and Trellises' and 'Garden Secrets', the book offers a wealth of design advice and problem solving solutions for traditional gardeners. Small space gardeners, DIYers and those looking to incorporate the latest vertical techniques into their gardens will appreciate sections that examine 'skinny space' planting beds, urban gardens, edibles and living walls.
