This was the second offering from the band, and a great follow-up to their successful debut &quot;The Ghosts that Haunt Me&quot; which featured the hit Superman's Song.\n\nSuperman's Song was always a favorite, but tunes like God Shuffled His Feet, Afternoons and Coffeespoons, In the Days of the Caveman, Here I Stand Before Me, and many other tracks on this CD just connect with the wondering human being in all of us. They're songs filled with questions and concerns, but also filled with a fire that strikes a chord of life.\n\nThe musicianship is top notch, and production is clean. I favor the sound of a tight rhythm section with a crisp snare; there is no shortage of syncopation here, and the drummer is outstanding. Nice acoustic guitar tones, great piano, and enchanting harmonies. Brad Roberts is known for his deep vocals, and here he really leaves his mark, especially on the most popular tune Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm.\n\nLyrically this album is refreshing. The writing is humble, inquiring, and clever, and most importantly devoid of cliche. This is music that makes you think, helps you understand and gives you a boost.\n\nI still find God Shuffled His Feet to be one of my very favorite CDs. If you're into interesting, original, and good music you won't be disappointed.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Crash Test Dummies - God Shuffled His Feet (Arista 74321-16531)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Crash Test Dummies\nAlbum................: God Shuffled His Feet (Arista 74321-16531)\nGenre................: Alternative\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
