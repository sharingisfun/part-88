Fur rendering is especially adapted to overheat the GPU and that's why FurMark is also a perfect stability and stress test tool (also called GPU burner) for the graphics card.\n\nI found this tool very useful for myself but ozone3d doesn't offer a portable version of this software, so I made it portable, just unzip and the software is there, no installer included or needed.\n\nThe official download page is http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/. The latest releases can be found there.\n\nFurMark is free for personal use. Commercial licenses can be found at http://www.ozone3d.net/g3dpp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1aa8afaa953a3820e55562871d8ed7d1a4855a","amp;dn":"FurMark+1.15+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1aa8afaa953a3820e55562871d8ed7d1a4855a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,26,168,175,170,149,58,56,32,229,85,98,135,29,142,215,209,164,133,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
