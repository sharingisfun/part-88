Cudney\n\n2015 | ISBN: 1482255383 | English | 322 pages | PDF | 19 MB\n\nA systematic approach to improving production and quality systems, total productive maintenance (TPM) involves all employees through a moderate investment in maintenance. Therefore, a successful TPM implementation requires support of all employees from C-level on down. Total Productive Maintenance: Strategies and Implementation Guide highlights the importance of effective communication on all levels to successful TPM implementation. It also discusses the role of the right set of tools from the right perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬â€¢and demonstrates how to obtain a healthy balance of both.\n\nAuthors Tina Agustiady and Elizabeth Cudney recognized a need for better understanding of how to apply and integrate the TPM philosophy and its associated tools and techniques. In this book they build a framework of problem-solving methods and tools from the TPM toolkit that help you understand the problems, develop process improvements, and develop a plan to implement change. They also provide an overview and introduction to the TPM methodology, detailed information on TPM implementation, and in-depth case studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edbec0ce2622db12fdab8482d9fe1decbe120c8b","amp;dn":"Total+Productive+Maintenance%3A+Strategies+and+Implementation+Guid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edbec0ce2622db12fdab8482d9fe1decbe120c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,190,192,206,38,34,219,18,253,171,132,130,217,254,29,236,190,18,12,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
