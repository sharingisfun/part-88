Go it alone or invite some friends locally or online to join in your adventure. Build a galactic empire by allying, defeating, and trading with many different alien races and factions. Find secrets and new alien races to contact buried away in the most remote systems of the galaxy, or unravel a galactic conspiracy in the main story. It is your choice and your adventure.\n\n- Engage in personal fleet combat\nControl multiple vessels at once with their unique systems and crew to fight off everything the galaxy can throw at you in real time. Build a carrier style ship that launches smaller fighter ships. Be a space pirate that teleports over to enemy ships to engage their crew in hand to hand combat as you plunder their cargo and steal their ships. You can even suffocate your opponents by hacking their life support systems. The choice is yours commander.\n\n- Discover new alien worlds\nThe galaxy is vast. Humanity and the races it has encountered have only started to scratch the surface of what is out there. Find uncontacted planets and do with them as you see fit. Raise new alien races into great space-faring races. Teleport down to the surface to explore. Search for ancient alien ruins. Hunt the local exotic alien monsters to tame for combat or sell them for profit. You can wipe out all life and mine the planets to their cores, or leave them alone but plant spies in their midst to study them for research. Their worlds are in your hands.\n\n- Negotiate to control\nInteract with different fleets, alien races, and factions throughout the galaxy. Diplomacy, spying, and economic trade can be just as useful to crush your enemies as military strength. Communications are dynamic and ever evolving. Unlock new quests, alliances, and missions to advance the story or be the greatest terror the galaxy has ever seen.\n\n- Customize Your Fleet\nEverything in your fleet can be customized. Unlock and build new ships, space stations, and planetary bases. Choose what systems to install and where by placing the rooms in the vessels by where the blocks fit using a Tetris style system. Ensure your fleet always has a crew by utilizing clones. Research new and exotic technologies for new systems to get the edge in your galactic adventures. Your fleet, your rules.\n\n- Command your crew\nYour crew members are the lifeblood of the vessels you deploy them in. Command your crew to repair ships, control systems, board enemy ships, or go down to explore planets. Each individual being in your crew gains experience which can be used to level up them through their careers and change jobs to gain new abilities and stats to fulfill niches within your fleet.\n\nMore info:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://spacewrights.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://spacewrights.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRead how-to-play.txt for some tips.\n\nV05 changelog:\n- Fans can now mod this Spacewrights demo!\n- Check out the website for more details, or dig around in the mods/ folder\n- Tile damage is no longer visible as it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do anything [yet]\n- A bunch of smaller bugs fixed as well\n\nVote for it on Steam Greenlight:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=spacewrights+greenlight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=spacewrights+greenlight&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSupport it on Kickstarter:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arithmebit/spacewrights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arithmebit/spacewrights&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3bd8337e0e6ded4d66142bbac82160ef8a78b2e","amp;dn":"Spacewrights+Demo+V05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3bd8337e0e6ded4d66142bbac82160ef8a78b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,189,131,55,224,230,222,212,214,97,66,187,172,130,22,14,248,167,139,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
