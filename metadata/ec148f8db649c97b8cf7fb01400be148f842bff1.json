In contrast to common dictionaries, this book does not have trivial entries (e.g. filter/Filter, metal/Metall, vacuum/Vakuum, project/Projekt). Only terms that are relevant for work, 2600, were selected.\nAfter studying these terms from the areas of chemistry, engineering and chemical engineering, supplemented by important entries from neighbouring disciplines such as pharmaceutics, economics, law and safety, the reader will have a solid vocabulary at his/her disposal, so that he/she can communicate in all areas of the process industries in a competent way and make use of the scientific and technical literature efficiently","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec148f8db649c97b8cf7fb01400be148f842bff1","amp;dn":"Chemical+Engineering+Vocabulary+-+Maximilian+Lackner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec148f8db649c97b8cf7fb01400be148f842bff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,20,143,141,182,73,201,123,140,247,251,1,64,11,225,72,248,66,191,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
