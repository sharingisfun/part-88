Organic agriculturist and lecturer AndrÃƒÂ© Leu delves into a wealth of respected scientific journals to present the peer-reviewed evidence that proves the claims of chemical companies and pesticide regulators are not all they seem. Leu translates technical jargon into layman s terms to break down the five most-repeated myths about pesticide safety, refuting them using scientific data. The pesticide industry argues that agriculture, and the global population itself, cannot survive without its products, but Leu warns that we are at risk unless we break free of their toxic hold and turn to more natural methods of pest and weed regulation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebddf95e3d41081604ec5c9d672f722252f24b89","amp;dn":"The+Myths+of+Safe+Pesticides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebddf95e3d41081604ec5c9d672f722252f24b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,221,249,94,61,65,8,22,4,236,92,157,103,47,114,34,82,242,75,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
