Garden designers Sara Begg Townsend and Roanne Robbins offer an innovative system for creating stylish container gardens that can change with the seasons with a minimum of fuss. They begin with a &quot;main-stage&quot; plant--a woody plant, garden ornament, or eye-catching perennial--and then add a secondary player for texture and variety. As the seasons change, they show how easy it is to swap plants in and out for a dynamic display that looks great year-round. Their simple approach yields endless variations, seasonal bursts of color, and varied textures that echo the ever-changing beauty of nature. The book features designs for twelve containers, each with a unique plan for swapping plants every season, for a total of 48 exciting looks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7aae62d5e3ada990a88946e81bfc7fb7625968","amp;dn":"Continuous+Container+Gardens%3A+Swap+In+the+Plants+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7aae62d5e3ada990a88946e81bfc7fb7625968","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,122,174,98,213,227,173,169,144,168,137,70,232,27,252,127,183,98,89,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
