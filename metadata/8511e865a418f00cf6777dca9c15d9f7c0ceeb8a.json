It definitely wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the crash that killed these people.\n\nWhile Lindsay starts to piece this case together, she gets a call she wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expecting. Sightings of her ex-colleague-turned-ruthless-killer Mackie Morales have been reported.\n\nWanted for three murders, Mackie has been in hiding since she escaped from custody. But now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ready to return to San Francisco and pay a visit to some old friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8511e865a418f00cf6777dca9c15d9f7c0ceeb8a","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+%26amp%3B+Maxine+Paetro+-+Unlucky+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8511e865a418f00cf6777dca9c15d9f7c0ceeb8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,17,232,101,164,24,240,12,246,119,125,202,156,21,217,247,192,206,235,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
