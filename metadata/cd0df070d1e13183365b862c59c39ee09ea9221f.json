Joan has helped over 5,000 hedgehogs and gets deeply attached to her patients. With the help of expert Dr Richard Yarnell and his technology, Julian and the team are able track the progress of one of JoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precious patients after he is released back into the wild. Jo is overwhelmed with emotion at the prospect of tracking her hedgehogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movements.\n \nNext, the team are on to Lichfield to meet Nature Nut number two, Kate MacRae, who captures the activity of our feathered friends, with numerous cameras placed around her garden and inside her bird boxes, which she streams onto the internet.\n \nThe team also visit a quiet bank, filled with holes from badger sets. Despite spending many hours watching the bank in the hope of spotting the badgers, Kate has never caught so much as a glimpse of them.\n \nTogether with expert wildlife camerawoman, Justine Evans and some military technology which means her camera can work with just the light of the moon, Julian and Kate head to a tent in the nearby woods to see if they can catch sight of a very elusive family of badgers.\n \nIn Stowe Maries, Julian meets Russell Savory and turns his attention to the water vole, a creature that is fast disappearing due to reintroduced mink and loss of habitat. \n \nIn Tyne and Wear, Julian meets otter spotter Kevin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hara and then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s down to Dorset for one final trip to introduce him to retired trout farmer and fellow otter fanatic Stewart Canham.  After capturing footage of otters playing, the last leg of JulianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey sees him and Stewart make a trip to a very special otter sanctuary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0df070d1e13183365b862c59c39ee09ea9221f","amp;dn":"Nature.Nuts.With.Julian.Clary.s01e01.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0df070d1e13183365b862c59c39ee09ea9221f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,13,240,112,209,225,49,131,54,91,134,44,89,195,158,224,158,169,34,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
