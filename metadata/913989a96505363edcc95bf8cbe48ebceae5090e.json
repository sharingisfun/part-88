In so doing, they describe the latest ideas on efficient design, illustrating when to produce which part of the equipment and with which resources, so as to optimize chemical plants for high capacity and flexibility. \n\nThis book gives an overview of the state-of-the-art of the whole logistic chain of chemical production processes.\n\nAlongside the fundamentals, tools and algorithms, and integration issues, the book features five significant industrial case studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913989a96505363edcc95bf8cbe48ebceae5090e","amp;dn":"Logistic+Optimization+of+Chemical+Production+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913989a96505363edcc95bf8cbe48ebceae5090e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,57,137,169,101,5,54,62,220,201,91,248,203,228,142,188,234,229,9,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
