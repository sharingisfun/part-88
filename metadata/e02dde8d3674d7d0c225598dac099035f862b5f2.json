For some reason, the English audio is a bit choppy on my computer, but the Japanese audio plays fine if just a little behind the video. Any help on fixing these problems would be greatly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02dde8d3674d7d0c225598dac099035f862b5f2","amp;dn":"The+Very+Short+Azumanga+Daioh+Movie+%28dual+audio%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02dde8d3674d7d0c225598dac099035f862b5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,45,222,141,54,116,215,208,194,37,89,141,172,9,144,53,248,98,181,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
