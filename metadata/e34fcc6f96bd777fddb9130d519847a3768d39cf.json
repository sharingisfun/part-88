This is the chilling story of a two-year-long investigation into a dangerous criminal underworld and the merciless syndicates that will stop at nothing to obtain their prize. It is a tale of greed, folly and corruption, and of an increasingly desperate battle to save the rhino - which has existed for more than 50 million years - from extinction.\n\nKilling for Profit is a meticulous, devastating and revelatory account of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most secretive trades. It exposes poachers, scoundrels, gangsters, conmen, mercenaries, killers, gun-runners, diplomats, government officials and kingpins behind the slaughter. And it follows the bloody trail from the frontlines of the rhino wars in south Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to the medicine markets of Vietnam and the lair of a wildlife-trafficking kingpin on the banks of the Mekong River in Laos Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nProduct Details:\nFile size: epub 2,439 Kb, mobi 2,661 Kb\nPublisher: Zebra Press\neISBN: 978 177022 335 6\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e34fcc6f96bd777fddb9130d519847a3768d39cf","amp;dn":"Killing+for+Profit+ebook+by+Julian+Rademeyer+epub+mobi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e34fcc6f96bd777fddb9130d519847a3768d39cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,79,204,111,150,189,119,127,221,185,19,13,81,152,71,163,118,141,57,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
