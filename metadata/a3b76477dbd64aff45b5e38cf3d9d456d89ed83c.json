Published in the 1960s/70s, this series is a history of the world's cultures. Despite its age, Ancient China is a good introduction to early Chinese history, religion, cosmology, art, and literature. Chapter Three describes the religion of China and is especially informative. As with other books in this series, there are numerous illustrations and maps which supplement the narrative. A time line, index, and bibliography are also included. In conclusion, Ancient China is a good place to start your study of one of the oldest cultures in the world. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3b76477dbd64aff45b5e38cf3d9d456d89ed83c","amp;dn":"Great+Ages+of+man+-+Ancient+China+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3b76477dbd64aff45b5e38cf3d9d456d89ed83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,183,100,119,219,214,74,255,69,181,227,140,243,217,212,86,216,158,216,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
