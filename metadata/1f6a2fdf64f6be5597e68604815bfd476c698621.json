Formed in late 2011 by singer Ãƒâ€“rvar Ingi, guitarists Elvar Bragason and Magni Freyr, bassist SamÃƒÂºel Ãƒâ€“rn and the sweatiest man in all of rock music's long history, drummer Hjalti ÃƒÅ¾ÃƒÂ³r. The band has a modus operandi of trying to sound like nothing they have ever heard. Singer Ãƒâ€“rvar has quite a taste for flinging shit at everyone and everything he dislikes and uses this platform of being in a band to write lyrics concerning anti-establishment and criticizing the detriments of society, or the detriment that is society. One day he realized that he was in a death metal band and no one would understand one word he said. That made him sad.\n     After almost two years, the album is finally out digitally, but yet to be released on CD. The band officially apologizes for not pressing a single copy on vinyl. The album, named &quot;Eschaton&quot;, revolves heavily, as the name suggests, around the speculations on the end stages of various things. Ãƒâ€“rvar always had a philosophical interest in entropy and the mythological end of the world, so Eschaton, by accident or by a subconscious master plan, turned out to be a lyrical concept album, focusing on the concept of what perplexes so many of us: &quot;The End&quot;.\nTrack list:\n1.
