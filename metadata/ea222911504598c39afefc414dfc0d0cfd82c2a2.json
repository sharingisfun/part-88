Although not an overtly political piece, for many it raised questions about race, sexual attraction to men, and violence. It shows a wrestling match between two men who alternate ambiguous relations and gestures of aggression and erotic attraction. The film's protagonists, one of them McQueen, are both black, but issues of race, he has said, do not take priority in his work. Like all McQueen's early films, Bear is black-and-white, and was shot on 16-millimetre film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea222911504598c39afefc414dfc0d0cfd82c2a2","amp;dn":"Bear.1993.DVDRipx264-HANDJOB+%28Steve+McQueen+short+film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea222911504598c39afefc414dfc0d0cfd82c2a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,34,41,17,80,69,152,195,154,254,252,65,77,252,13,12,253,130,194,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
