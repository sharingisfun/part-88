Mitchell (Wiley, 2004).pdf\n\nISBN: 0471436232\n\nAn Introduction to Materials Engineering and Science for Chemical and Materials Engineers provides a solid background in materials engineering and science for chemical and materials engineering students. This book:\nOrganizes topics on two levels; by engineering subject area and by materials class.\nIncorporates instructional objectives, active-learning principles, design-oriented problems, and web-based information and visualization to provide a unique educational experience for the student.\nProvides a foundation for understanding the structure and properties of materials such as ceramics/glass, polymers, composites, bio-materials, as well as metals and alloys.\nTakes an integrated approach to the subject, rather than a &quot;metals first&quot; approach","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01da07b4aadba378e6e97577f375eee0934f3b2","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Materials+Engineering+and+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01da07b4aadba378e6e97577f375eee0934f3b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,29,160,123,74,173,186,55,142,110,151,87,127,55,94,238,9,52,243,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
