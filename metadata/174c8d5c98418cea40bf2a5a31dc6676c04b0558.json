Think Borderlands meets Tron. The cyber-world is procedurally generated, the colors are neon, the loot is randomized, and the lasers are loud. Black Ice is currently in Beta, with updates on the way.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Fast-paced First Person Combat \n* Billions of randomly generated items - Railguns! Rocket shotguns! Jetpacks! \n* Seamless 10-player online multiplayer - PVE and PVP! \n* A shiny, procedurally-generated neon world \n* Extremely open development \n* A wonderful original soundtrack (On Sale Here!) by epic composer V-Axys \n* Award-winning, addictive gameplay with high replay value \n* Mod Support \n* Photosensitive Mode\n\n____________________\n\n\nChange Log:\n\nWARNING: This patch will break previous characters. They'll still load, but they won't be able to regenerate RAM. Please just create a new character. I tried really hard to avoid this, but was unable to. \n\nAdditions:\nBIG CHANGE: TL;DR: 10-Player multiplayer works with no problems now! I did a huge networking code update and you can *see* it in multiplayer games - all the projectiles move much more smoothly \nAdded a new unique item: The Disco Dodgeball. Must be picked up after fired, but can be retrieved by activating again \nAdded another new unique item: The Spicy Meatball, which is a bouncy fireball (with 100% ricochet but no innate piercing) \nAdded Gisborne Industries as a reference to Mike Bithell's new game, Volume. He's a really nice guy \nPlayers in multiplayer now get a +15% XP bonus for each player past the first \nIf you cheat, you will be marked as such \nApril Fool's day joke :) Wait and see!\n\nItem Balancing Changes:\nShotguns + high accuracy should feel more like shotguns now (more spread) \nNerfed bouncyball damage to be more in line with other weapons \nMine damage has been reduced (including spider mines). I doubt anyone will notice \nRAM Regen from leveling has been decreased \nRAM and RAM Regen from items has been decreased \nIcebreakers cost more RAM per hack now \nLasbreakers do more damage now \nHealth per Second items now cost more RAM and heal less per level\n\nOther Changes:\nYou can now see the highest level server you've hacked, which is important because: \nShops now sell loot only up to the level of the highest level server you've hacked \nGITSfish health has been lowered, but their damage has increased \nBitcred drops have been quadrupled \nMultiplayer city size is now set to max at all times - not infinite, but large. \nHacked buildings are much more transparent now, this should let people see the loot better (Known issue: They don't show up on Macs now) \nThe select button now closes the inventory menu on a controller \nPlayer and enemy movement in multiplayer is much more accurate now\n\nFixes:\nInvert controller toggle works now \nPunchthrough achievement works now \nThe Main Menu should lag less for lower-power machines. I expect this to improve next major patch when I upgrade to Unity 5 \nOverlapping buildings no longer spawn near the starting area \nNemesized servers now show up properly in multiplayer \nMines are colored appropriately in PVP now \nLoot (including dropped credits) from every server is now always the appropriate level \nShared XP in MP now has a minimum of 1, not 0\n\n____________________\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Extract .7z file anywhere\n\n2. Run Black Ice.exe\n\n3. ???\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE GAME BUY IT!
