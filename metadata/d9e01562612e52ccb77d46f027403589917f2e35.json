With this episode I believe we're completely caught up. (If I'm wrong, tell me!) From now on I hope to upload every new episode within 2 days of airing. (Ideally, night of.) Now that the WoS (hah) is over I'm going to start uploading The Independents. Be sure to check it out! If you like Stossel you'll probably like The Independents.\n\n\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE\n--------------\nGIVE ME A... CHOICE\n\nMY TAKE: People tell libertarians who complain about government limiting choice: &quot;What are you whining about? People can vote the bums out.&quot; Democracy is a sort of free market. We choose our representatives.\n\nBut compared to a real free market, the political process is vastly inferior. We get to vote for politicians once every two... or four ...or six years.\n\nIn the private sector, we vote with our dollars. We get to vote often, for more stuff. Competition requires businesses to innovate or lose votes and die.\n\nAlso, and most important, politics is a package deal. Vote for Obama, you get Obama policies. But in the free market, we have a million choices. Suppose you chose food the way we choose politicians. You get two choices- donkey meat or elephant meat. Then, no matter how you voted, you have to eat what the majority picked.\n\nIn the free market supermarket, I can pick elephant and you can pick donkey. Even the in the simplest supermarket, we can each get what we want. That's why government should be kept small.\n\nOBAMACARE MANDATES: Obama sold his signature healthcare law by saying it would lower costs and give us more choices. In truth, more people are covered, but we have less choice and higher costs.\n\nRIGHT TO TRY: If you have a terminal illness, you should be able to try any treatment you think might save your life. But today, you cannot.\n\nIn Vermont, two brothers suffer from the same terminal illness, but the FDA has only approved the drug for the younger brother, Max. Max continues to get better while his older brother, Austin, will likely die.\n\nARE DEMOCRATS THE PARTY OF CHOICE? Democrats often call themselves the &quot;party of choice.&quot; But they're almost always talking only about abortion. When it comes to other choices-like the right to choose your child's school...or not join a union..or buy a gun-they're not so big on choice. I fight Alan Colmes, who says everybody benefits from these restrictions.\n\nARE REPUBLICANS THE PARTY OF CHOICE? Republicans have their choices they like to ban. Most want to limit gay marriage, drugs, sex work, gambling, and flag burning.\n\nINNOVATION: The internet gives us more choices. New ridesharing services like Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar offer terrific alternatives to traditional taxis. But government bureaucrats and cab companies aren't happy about this. But the new companies are doing great-they're outrunning the regulators. It's corporate civil disobedience.\n\nfoxbusiness[.]com/on-air/stossel/blog/2014/07/29/let-us-experiment\n\n\n\nINFO:\n-----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB. (310 video 40 audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Stossel.2014.09.25.Give.Me.A.Choice.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6a22030d022a2659445a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 5s \nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9e01562612e52ccb77d46f027403589917f2e35","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.09.25.Give.Me.A.Choice.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9e01562612e52ccb77d46f027403589917f2e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,224,21,98,97,46,82,204,183,125,70,240,39,64,53,137,145,127,46,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
