The authors detail emerging applications of vertically-oriented graphene such as field emitters, atmospheric nanoscale corona discharges, gas sensors and biosensors, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells (catalyst supports) and electrochemical transducers. They offer a perspective on current challenges to enabling commercial applications of vertically-oriented graphene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b838ad3ae2ed5b7ca7a310b684b638888337ecfd","amp;dn":"Vertically-Oriented+Graphene+-+PECVD+Synthesis+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b838ad3ae2ed5b7ca7a310b684b638888337ecfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,56,173,58,226,237,91,124,167,163,16,182,132,182,56,136,131,55,236,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
