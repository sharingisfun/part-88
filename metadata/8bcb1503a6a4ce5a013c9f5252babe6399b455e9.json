Though the band's early years\nwere shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their experience of the\nearly 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and\nhelped them incorporate elements of that style into their work.\n\nThe band's 1983 hit &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one\nexample of how the band transformed their sound.\n\nNew Order were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label\nFactory Records. Their minimalist album sleeves and &quot;non-image&quot; (the band rarely gave\ninterviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected\nthe label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do,\nincluding an aversion to including singles as album tracks.\n\nIn 1993, the band worked on their own individual projects and reunited as a band in 1998.\nIn 2001, Cunningham (guitars, keyboards and synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who took a\nsabbatical from the band because of family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band.\nAfter Hook's departure, Bernard, Phil and Steve worked on Bad Lieutenant and the band\nreunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert's return and Chapman replacing Hook on bass.\nDuring the band's career and in between lengthy breaks, band members have been involved\nin several solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco\nand Revenge and Gilbert and Morris' The Other Two.\n\nCunningham was previously a member of Marion and with Sumner and Chapman was a\nmember of Bad Lieutenant.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: New Order\nAlbum: Substance 1987\nGenre: Electronic / Synth-Pop / Pop / Indie Rock / Rock / 80s\nSource: Double CD\nAlbum Release Year: 1987\nLabel: Factory Records\nCatalog No: Facd 200\nNumber of Tracks: 24\nTotal Duration: 02:26:59\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.3.1\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 851 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [Stereo]\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File ID Tags [FLAC]: VorbisComment\nAudio File ID Tags [MP3]: id3v2.3, id3v1\nIncluded Artwork: Front and back booklet plus inlay\nAdditional Files: Log, Cue, MD5, SFV, FFP, Txt, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.20 GB\n\n\nTrack List - CD1\n\n01.
