A multi-instrumentalist, he can play keyboards, bass guitar, drums, guitar, mandolin, violin, and other strings.\nWinwood was a key member of The Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, Blind Faith and Go. He also had a successful solo career with hits including &quot;Valerie&quot;, &quot;Back in the High Life Again&quot; and two US Billboard Hot 100 number ones; &quot;Higher Love&quot; and &quot;Roll With It&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Traffic in 2004.\nIn 2005 Winwood was honoured as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI London Awards for his &quot;enduring influence on generations of music makers.&quot; In 2008, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Winwood #33 in its 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Winwood has won two Grammy Awards.\n\nSteve Winwood is now approaching the 50 year mark in his career. He began as the boy wonder of The Spencer Davis Group during the mid-1960s with such songs as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gimme Some LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m A Man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It was then on to the British psychedelic rock blues band Traffic, which would lead to The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Then there was a short stop in the super group Blind Faith.\nWhile he would reunite with Traffic, he began his solo career during 1977 with a self-titled album. His second 1980 release, Arc Of A Diver, signaled the beginning of huge commercial and critical success. That album will be reissued next month as a two-CD deluxe edition complete with bonus tracks.\nArc Of A Diver was very representative of his solo work. While his soulful vocals remained intact, the music was smoother and more mainstream in nature. The production and sound were impeccable, which was a significant upgrade from his group work.\nThe album was a complete Steve Winwood affair. He played all the instruments including the guitars, bass, drums, and synthesizers. He did not stop there as he also produced and engineered the album. To complete his total control, he wrote or co-wrote all of the tracks.\nThere is a lot to like here. Ã¢â‚¬Å“While You See A ChanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was just about a perfect pop rock song as it meandered along. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spanish DancerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was proof that the early 1980s could produce good synthesizer driven music. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slowdown-SundownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ falls into a mellow groove that lulls you and stays in your mind. I have always been drawn to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Night Train,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its somewhat funky sound and a brilliant guitar solo by Winwood. The title track sort of sums up the album and its breezy pop approach.\nOver three decades after its original release, the music holds up surprisingly well. It may not be as creative as some of his work with Traffic, but it is an album and music well worth revisiting.\n\nDFF files extracted with Scarletbook\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10942620/Scarletbook-SACD-Extractor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the Japanese SHM-SACD.\n\nSHM-SACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ffc47a1995d8089aa087807948a46a5b23ff79","amp;dn":"Steve+Winwood+-+Arc+Of+A+Diver++%281980%29+2014+SHM-SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ffc47a1995d8089aa087807948a46a5b23ff79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,255,196,122,25,149,216,8,154,160,135,128,121,72,164,106,91,35,255,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
