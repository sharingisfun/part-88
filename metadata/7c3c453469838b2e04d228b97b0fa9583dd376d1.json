The number of accidents with mobility scooter drivers is increasing, and there's very little regulation, as mobility scooter drivers don't need to pass a proficiency test and insurance is not compulsory. Even being registered blind doesn't legally stop you being allowed to drive one.\n\nWith access to South Yorkshire Police's mobility scooter driving school, this warm-hearted, engaging and informative documentary follows the lives of scooter users in South Yorkshire, Derbyshire and north Wales. We meet those living their twilight years to the full with the help of a four-wheeled friend and also hear the stories of those who have fallen foul of the mobility scooter phenomenon.\n\nWith failing health a common theme, the documentary is as much about mortality as it is mobility","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3c453469838b2e04d228b97b0fa9583dd376d1","amp;dn":"The+Trouble+With+Mobility+Scooters+ENG+SUBS+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3c453469838b2e04d228b97b0fa9583dd376d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,60,69,52,105,131,139,46,4,210,40,185,123,15,169,88,61,211,118,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
