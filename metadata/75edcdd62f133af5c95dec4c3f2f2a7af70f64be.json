Webber, a pastor at the Southwest Radio Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nThis book was written in 1978 (updated 1980) and predicts how the world will end by the year 2000 and revelations is being fulfilled because of the coming of the digital age.\n\nThe book is filled with both religious and science articles all showing the concern with the coming digital age ALL OF WHICH has been shown to be inaccurate. Please do not post about how Christianly is evil, I really don't care.\n\nThis is for educational and historical purposes only, it's just a fun book on how some people in 1978 saw the future.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nPublisher: The Southwest Radio Church\n1978 \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: none\nscanned PDF\n92 Pages\n68 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75edcdd62f133af5c95dec4c3f2f2a7af70f64be","amp;dn":"The+Computers+are+Coming%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75edcdd62f133af5c95dec4c3f2f2a7af70f64be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,237,205,214,47,19,58,245,201,93,236,76,63,47,42,122,247,15,100,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
