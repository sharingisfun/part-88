Regardless of your answer, there is absolutely no question that Texas Hippie Coalition are ready to party their asses off with their latest album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemaker.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nEleven tracks of non-stop gritty, groovy and down right dirty party rock make up THCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest endeavor. From the opening Ã¢â‚¬ËœGet Your Hands UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the closer Ã¢â‚¬ËœThink of Me,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ this record is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand opus to party rock.\n\nSounding like the bastard that spawned from a threesome between Monster Magnet, Willie Nelson and Pantera, THC has already carved out a spot for themselves in the world of metal with their brand of red dirt rock.\n\nWhat Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ does, though, is takes that brand and elevates it to a more significant level. The band sounds tighter than ever, the guitar riffs are incredibly crushing to say the least and the lyrics are exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to love and adore about this band.\n\nThe track that sums up the album has to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœDamn You To Hell.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ From the opening guitar riff to the unforgettable chorus, this song takes no prisoners. With lyrics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have a big olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ truck / And I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get stuck / You think I suck / And I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give a fÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a lunatic and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m about to be sick / IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a maniac and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m about to attackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ makes this tune shine. Consider this the anthem for THC.\n\nAnother killer track on Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemaker is the first single Ã¢â‚¬ËœTurn It Up.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Lead singer Big Dad Ritch takes fans on a trip down strip club lane with lyrics like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little Sarah was from Texas / She was the preacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter / She never practiced much of what her father taught her.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If you like the lyrics, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love the music video Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trust us.\n\nSo is Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the album that is going to blow up the genre? No. THC have their own way of doing things, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what sets them apart from others in the metal scene. You can hear the red dirt and Southern influence in their music, creating a memorable experience for anyone who hears Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemaker.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nThis isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t merely a party album (although we must admit, it is the perfect record to play beginning to end the next time you throw a little barbecue). Blast after blast of their signature rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, THC sets the stage with Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for what just might be one helluva breakout year for the band.\n\nIn Ã¢â‚¬ËœDamn You To Hell,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Big Dad Ritch says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you want something, come on / Yeah, if this is what you want, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get it on.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ We wanted something and THC gave us Ã¢â‚¬ËœPeacemaker.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good enough for us.Heavy\nSubgenre:\tSouthern Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t97.76 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\nFile Name \tSize\n2012 Peacemaker/01- Hands Up.mp3 \t9.03 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/02- Damn You To Hell.mp3 \t8.26 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/03- 8 Seconds.mp3 \t9.24 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/04- Outlaw.mp3 \t6.89 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/05- Turn It Up.mp3 \t8.55 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/06- Wicked.mp3 \t8.60 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/07- Don't Come Lookin'.mp3 \t8.79 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/08- Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock And Roll.mp3 \t8.88 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/09- Paw Paw Hill.mp3 \t9.23 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/10- Peacemaker.mp3 \t10.05 MB\n2012 Peacemaker/11- Think Of Me.mp3 \t10.25 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8380a4cf01030a69d3381b970a835e32d4b15b71","amp;dn":"+Texas+Hippie+Coalition+-+Peacemaker+++mp3++++%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8380a4cf01030a69d3381b970a835e32d4b15b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,128,164,207,1,3,10,105,211,56,27,151,10,131,94,50,212,177,91,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
