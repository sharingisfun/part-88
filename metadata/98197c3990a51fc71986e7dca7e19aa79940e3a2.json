This year something is increasing the body count. Jim ('John Schneider') and his research team trek into the Canadian wilderness to study the Canadian Lynx every year. However, this year is different. The Lynx are missing. In fact most of the wildlife is missing; Jim and his team, including his beautiful daughter Emmy (Danielle Chuchran), seek to find out why. As they conduct their study, something is stalking them. Something not human. Something that no prey can escape...including human prey! While the research team is trying to find out why the lynx have disappeared, the local ranger ('Jason London') is searching for the answer to what is making tourist disappear; even if it the last thing he ever does.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623765&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98197c3990a51fc71986e7dca7e19aa79940e3a2","amp;dn":"Snow+Beast+2011+624x352.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98197c3990a51fc71986e7dca7e19aa79940e3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,25,124,57,144,165,31,199,25,134,231,220,167,225,154,167,153,64,227,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
