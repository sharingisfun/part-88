The twoÃ¢â‚¬â€œvolume &quot;Handbuch des TunnelÃ¢â‚¬â€œ und Stollenbaus&quot; has been the standard reference work for GermanÃ¢â‚¬â€œspeaking tunnellers in theory and practice for 30 years. The new English edition is based on a revised and adapted version of the third German edition and reflects the latest state of knowledge. The book is published in two volumes, with the second volume covering both theoretical themes like design basics, geological engineering, structural design of tunnels and monitoring instrumentation, and also the practical side of work on the construction site such as dewatering, waterproofing and scheduling as well as questions of tendering, award and contracts, data management and process controlling. As with volume I, all chapters include practical examples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f052cab4e9f5a2593f508dc517898516f50058ff","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Tunnel+Engineering+I+%26amp%3B+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f052cab4e9f5a2593f508dc517898516f50058ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,82,202,180,233,245,162,89,63,80,141,197,23,137,133,22,245,0,88,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
