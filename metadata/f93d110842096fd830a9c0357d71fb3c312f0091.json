Unfortunately the thing is rather more powerful than expected and they end up in an enormous cavern at the centre of the earth. Here they find a race of humans enslaved to evil oversized prehistoric birds with extra-sensory abilities. The travellers decide they can be some help, the more so as at least one of the slaves is very eye-catching.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93d110842096fd830a9c0357d71fb3c312f0091","amp;dn":"At+The+Earths+Core+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93d110842096fd830a9c0357d71fb3c312f0091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,61,17,8,66,9,111,216,48,169,192,53,125,113,251,60,49,47,0,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
