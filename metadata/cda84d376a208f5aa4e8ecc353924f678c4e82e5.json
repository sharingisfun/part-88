Nigel Lamb is the current Red Bull Air Race champion, which makes him the airborne equivalent of Lewis Hamilton. His MX2 aircraft is Formula 1 quick as well. But Tiff and Vicki also have a very special machine, a Ã‚Â£300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. Once Vicki has experienced a ride in NigelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plane, and Nigel has had a spin in the Lamborghini, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for them to go head to head. The aircraft is faster, but the car can turn tighter. The result is very close.\n\nthanks to capper and poster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda84d376a208f5aa4e8ecc353924f678c4e82e5","amp;dn":"Fifth+Gear+S26E01+PDTV+x264+TVC+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda84d376a208f5aa4e8ecc353924f678c4e82e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,168,77,55,106,32,143,90,164,232,236,195,83,146,79,103,140,78,130,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
