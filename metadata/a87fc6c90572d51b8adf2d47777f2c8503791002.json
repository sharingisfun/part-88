It culminated with the works of the three undisputed giants of Italian art, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo 1475-1564 and Raphael (1483-1520). Beginning with the heroic naturalism of Masaccio, who was one of the great Florentine masters of the early fifteenth century, the book surveys the whole of this remarkable era, ending with the glowing, richly coloured canvases of the great Venetian masters, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese, in the second half of the sixteenth century. A short introduction to the period is followed by notes on the artists and on the works by which they are represented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87fc6c90572d51b8adf2d47777f2c8503791002","amp;dn":"Italian+Renaissance+Painting+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87fc6c90572d51b8adf2d47777f2c8503791002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,127,198,201,5,114,213,27,138,223,45,71,119,127,44,133,3,121,16,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
