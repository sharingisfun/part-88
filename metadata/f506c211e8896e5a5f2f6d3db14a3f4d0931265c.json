Hope you guys enjoy\n\n\n------------\n\n\nChangelog for version 1.0.177: \n\n\nFor the recent Mac OS update 10.9.5, we have released a hotfix that solves signature issues. \n\nWe seized this opportunity to also fix the combat log disappearing for some of you, and fix jumping journal entries. \n\nIf you load a savegame in which the combat log was gone, you may have to drag it above the skillbar to be able to resize it again. \n\nOn the Mac version, the GodRays effect was distorted and this was fixed as well. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f506c211e8896e5a5f2f6d3db14a3f4d0931265c","amp;dn":"Divinity+Original+Sin+%281.0.169+To+1.0.177+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f506c211e8896e5a5f2f6d3db14a3f4d0931265c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,6,194,17,232,137,110,90,95,47,109,61,177,74,63,77,9,49,38,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
