He was handsome, charming, witty, and irresistible. Jayden Monroe came along when I was struggling with indecision and made things simple, turned monochrome into vivid color, and forever altered my perspective on life.\n\nI was not naive enough to believe in happily ever after, but with Jayden, it seemed possible . . . until I realized something wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite right.\n\nYou see, I met a man who would be anyone I needed him to be, and after I found out that fact, I knew it would be impossible to walk away. His disorder, however, would change everything I ever thought about love and what it truly meant to accept someone for who they are.\n\nThis is not my sob story; this is his success story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc9712e70b1e2f21c06375fa8a3a09855f67a38c","amp;dn":"Loving+The+White+Liar+-+Kate+Stewart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc9712e70b1e2f21c06375fa8a3a09855f67a38c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,151,18,231,11,30,47,33,192,99,117,250,138,58,9,133,95,103,163,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
