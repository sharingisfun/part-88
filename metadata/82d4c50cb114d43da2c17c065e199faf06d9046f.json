With their fragile surfaces and delicate proportions, tables, chairs, and other pieces of furniture enhanced the elite's indulgence in leisurely pursuits, fostering highly complex standards of etiquette and performance. Men and women restated the splendor of the Rococo and Neoclassical interiors of the period in their opulent costumes. For the eighteenth-century libertine and femme du monde, a refined elegance and delicate voluptuousness infused their world with a mood of amorous delight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d4c50cb114d43da2c17c065e199faf06d9046f","amp;dn":"Dangerous+Liaisons+-+Fashion+and+Furniture+in+the+XVIII+Century+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d4c50cb114d43da2c17c065e199faf06d9046f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,212,197,12,177,20,212,61,162,193,124,6,94,25,159,175,6,217,4,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
