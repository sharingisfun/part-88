The acoustics of the old church, nestled in the core of downtown Toronto and surrounded by towers and malls, could clearly be heard in this wonderful recording, right down to the hum of the ventilation system accidentally left on during the first few minutes.\n\nTwenty-five years later they gathered together a group of talented performers including Natalie Merchant and re-created this classic as Trinity Revisited.\n\nThe album itself is incredible, but in full video we can witness the beauty of the church, and the interaction of the musicians as they play. All the subtle nods and cues as the magic comes together.\n\nPresented here in 16:9 with DD5.1 audio it is a masterpiece of folk, rock and bluesy soul that I recommend everyone hears at least once.\n\nEnjoy and please seed - share the music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ba8c9a280bedfbdadee649626e5edcce416d64","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+-+Trinity+Revisted+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ba8c9a280bedfbdadee649626e5edcce416d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,186,140,154,40,11,237,251,218,222,230,73,98,110,94,220,206,65,109,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
