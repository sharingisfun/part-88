Abrams | 2003 | Pdf | English | ISBN:10 1413182240 | 52 pages | 7.99 MB\n\nRomare Bearden (1911-1988) described his way of making art as &quot;putting something over something else.&quot; Experimenting with fabric, photographs, colored papers, and other materials, Bearden expanded the possibilities of collage, inventing his own unique style.\nWhile firmly rooted in African-American culture, his life-affirming art speaks to everyone. Born in the South and raised in Harlem, Bearden's artworks are filled with images from everyday life. Quilting bees, cotton pickers, revival meetings, as well as city streets and jazz musicians, all formed the memories he would later turn into art.\nAward-winning author Jan Greenberg uses Bearden's art to tell his life story, providing a unique look at one of the most important American artists of the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81db27ee9b7e8567cee3c94dcac5814a482326c3","amp;dn":"Romare+Bearden+-+Collage+of+Memories+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81db27ee9b7e8567cee3c94dcac5814a482326c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,219,39,238,155,126,133,103,206,227,201,77,202,197,129,74,72,35,38,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
