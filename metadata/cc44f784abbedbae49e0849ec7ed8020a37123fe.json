I learned very quickly that the police can't protect individual citizens from violence. We would like to. We are willing to risk our lives to try. But to assume cops can be everywhere the thugs are, is not college-level thinking. Many good people understand this, and wonder whether carrying a concealed firearm on the streets would make them safer. Like most beat cops and working deputies I know, I support the right of responsible citizens to arm themselves. You see, we know better than most that, &quot;When seconds count, the cops are only minutes away.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc44f784abbedbae49e0849ec7ed8020a37123fe","amp;dn":"ABC%27s+of+Concealed+Carry%3A+A+Cop%27s+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc44f784abbedbae49e0849ec7ed8020a37123fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,68,247,132,171,190,219,174,73,224,132,158,199,237,128,32,163,113,35,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
