Buzz Aldrin, one of the first moonwalkers, has no shortage of these ideas. And in Mission to Mars he treats us to how, when, and why we should travel there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\nLegendary &quot;space statesman&quot; Buzz Aldrin speaks out as a vital advocate for the continuing quest to push the boundaries of the universe as we know it. As a pioneering astronaut who first set foot on the moon during mankind's first landing of Apollo 11--and as an aerospace engineer who designed an orbital rendezvous technique critical to future planetary landings--Aldrin has a vision, and in this book he plots out the path he proposes, taking humans to Mars by 2035.\n\nContents :\nChapter 1: The View from Air Force One\nChapter 2: Time for Decision-making\nChapter 3: Your Space: Building the Business Case\nChapter 4: Dreams of My Moon\nChapter 5: Voyage to Armageddon\nChapter 6: The March to Mars\nChapter 7: Homesteading the Red Planet\nChapter 8: The Clarion Call","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3032ca1d47684ce907e55d69212a47efe21c68f6","amp;dn":"Mission+to+Mars%3A+My+Vision+for+Space+Exploration+by+Buzz+Aldrin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3032ca1d47684ce907e55d69212a47efe21c68f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,50,202,29,71,104,76,233,7,229,93,105,33,42,71,239,226,28,104,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
