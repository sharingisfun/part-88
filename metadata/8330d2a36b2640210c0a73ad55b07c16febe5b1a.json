The passive remediation technology, currently in vogue, is based on permeable reactive barriers (PRB) that allow water to pass through while the fence/barrier made of reactive materials remediates the contaminants. Although PRB has been in operation for over a decade there are limited published books available. This book covers in one single volume all the information needed to plan, design/model and apply a successful, cost-effective and sustainable PRB technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8330d2a36b2640210c0a73ad55b07c16febe5b1a","amp;dn":"Permeable+Reactive+Barrier%3A+Sustainable+Groundwater+Remediation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8330d2a36b2640210c0a73ad55b07c16febe5b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,48,210,163,107,38,64,33,12,10,115,173,85,176,124,22,254,190,91,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
