The novice version is for those who have no knowledge of the craft and want shortcuts, but love the look. The expert version is for those who have a great deal of knowledge and proficiency of a certain craftÃ¢â‚¬â€the master art quilter, for example. For this version, an expert guest artist has created the cover and the author has created the binding. This offers yet another creative opportunity: the collaborative project. If you love getting involved with round-robins and other shared endeavors, this will show you yet another way to combine your skills with other crafters!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b25ce7fe62d3f3e5860ad2d8291c5511d4c753b","amp;dn":"Adventures+in+Bookbinding%3A+Handcrafting+Mixed-Media+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b25ce7fe62d3f3e5860ad2d8291c5511d4c753b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,37,206,127,230,45,63,62,88,96,173,45,130,145,197,81,29,76,117,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
