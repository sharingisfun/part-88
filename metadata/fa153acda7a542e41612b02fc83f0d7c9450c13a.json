In connection with the PBS Hands on Crafts for Kids television show comes a collection of simple and attractive beading projects for youngsters 10 and up. Young beaders can choose from 60 practical and decorative items, including pretty jewelry (bracelets, chokers), eye-catching room dÃƒÂ©cor (pillows, a lampshade), and personal accessories (flip-flops, a sophisticated looking jewelry box). Easy-to-follow diagrams explain how to string the beads, attach clasps, and tie knots. Kids will enjoy hours of creative pleasure--and they'll feel proud to show off their handiwork.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa153acda7a542e41612b02fc83f0d7c9450c13a","amp;dn":"20-Minute+Crafts+-+Beading+%282006%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa153acda7a542e41612b02fc83f0d7c9450c13a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,21,58,205,167,165,66,228,22,18,176,47,200,63,13,124,148,80,193,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
