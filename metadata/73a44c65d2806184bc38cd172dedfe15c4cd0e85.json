Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nINEQUALITY IN AMERICA: What is fair? Bill Gates has more than a thousand times the money I do. Robert Downey, Jr. is also rich and better looking and more famous than me. Angelina Jolie is richer and better looking than... most everyone.\n\nThat's unfair!\n\nObviously we are all different and unequal. And when it comes to unequal money, politicians want to do something about it. Elizabeth Warren says we need to &quot;raise the minimum wage,&quot; &quot;address student loans,&quot; and give &quot;equal pay for equal work.&quot;\n\nWill throwing more money at inequality make anything better? My guests debate.\n\nGIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUNDS: Fox Contributor Tamara Holder complains that they get paid 77 cents on the dollar. But despite what feminists say, women are not actually paid less for the same work.\n\nGOOD INTENTIONS GONE BAD: Before the War on Poverty began, blacks were lifting themselves out of poverty. &quot;Please Stop Helping Us&quot; author Jason Riley says progress stopped because today's &quot;welfare policies do not help people develop a work ethic.&quot;\n\nNET-NEUTRALITY: FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai says the new net neutrality plan will lead to higher prices, slower speeds, and fewer choices.\n\nMY TAKE: Instead of talking about fairness, it would be better if we talked about justice: respecting other people, respecting their freedom and their belongings. Then EVERYONE prospers. Real fairness requires limiting government power.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.03.13.Thats.Not.Fair.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73a44c65d2806184bc38cd172dedfe15c4cd0e85","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.03.13.Thats.Not.Fair.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73a44c65d2806184bc38cd172dedfe15c4cd0e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,164,76,101,210,128,97,132,188,56,205,23,45,237,254,21,196,205,14,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
