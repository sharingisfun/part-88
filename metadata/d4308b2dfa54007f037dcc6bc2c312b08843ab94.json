All three videos appear to be well-produced, with good quality sound and lighting.\n\nCantlie described himself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“long-term prisonerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and went on to criticise US president Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy for air strikes to defeat IS fighters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4308b2dfa54007f037dcc6bc2c312b08843ab94","amp;dn":"Lend+Me+Your+Ears+-+Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4308b2dfa54007f037dcc6bc2c312b08843ab94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,48,139,45,250,84,0,127,3,125,204,107,194,195,18,176,136,67,171,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
