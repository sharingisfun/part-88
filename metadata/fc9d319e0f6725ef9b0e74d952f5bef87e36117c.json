Their self-titled debut album featured a blend of hard rock laced with Ginger Baker's drumming. The lengthy &quot;Mad Jack&quot; was that album's outstanding track, and the album hit the US Billboard 200 chart, and peaked at #22 in the UK Albums Chart. The two following albums contained similar material, although neither charted in the UK nor the US.\n\nFormer The Gun and Three Man Army members Paul and Adrian Gurvitz joined forces with ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker in 1974. Things had not been going too well for Ginger Baker since the demise of his own band Ginger Baker's Air Force. The Gurvitz Brothers, too, were looking for a new way ahead after the early success of their band The Gun.\n\nWhen Cream split up in 1968, Baker was invited to join Blind Faith, which formed the following year. This was not such a successful venture and following its demise, Baker put together his own outfit, Ginger Baker's Airforce, in 1970. This band included many of his friends and musicians such as Graham Bond, Phil Seamen, Denny Laine and Steve Winwood. The band recorded two albums in 1970, one live and one studio album.\n\nAfter their debut, the band recorded two more studio albums, Elysian Encounter and Hearts On Fire. However, the death of their manager led to the band breaking up in 1976. In the aftermath Baker briefly led a band called Energy, and was associated with Atomic Rooster and Hawkwind. In 2003, a compilation album, Flying In And Out Of Stardom, was released with four new live songs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------\nMembers:\n--------\n\nGinger Baker: drums\n\nAdrian Gurvitz: guitar, vocals\n\nPaul Gurvitz: bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nMr. Snips a.k.a.
