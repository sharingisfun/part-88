Fomin \nFormat: PDF \nHardcover: 489 pages \nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (August 29, 2013) \nLanguage: English \nISBN: 978-3642391965 \n\n\nThis book deals with a new class of materials, quantum rings. Innovative recent advances in experimental and theoretical physics of quantum rings are based on the most advanced state-of-the-art fabrication and characterization techniques as well as theoretical methods. The experimental efforts allow to obtain a new class of semiconductor quantum rings formed by capping self-organized quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Novel optical and magnetic properties of quantum rings are associated with non-trivial topologies at the nanoscale. An adequate characterization of quantum rings is possible on the basis of modern characterization methods of nanostructures, such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. A high level of complexity is demonstrated to be needed for a dedicated theoretical model to adequately represent the specific features of quantum rings. The findings presented in this book contribute to develop low-cost high-performance electronic, spintronic, optoelectronic and information processing devices based on quantum rings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e7f8fcfb57d2c86da86d92c632298384e0969b4","amp;dn":"Physics+of+Quantum+Rings+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e7f8fcfb57d2c86da86d92c632298384e0969b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,127,143,207,181,125,44,134,218,134,217,44,99,34,152,56,78,9,105,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
