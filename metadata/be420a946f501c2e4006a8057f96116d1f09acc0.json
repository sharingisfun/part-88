Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGOVERNMENT MORTAGE COMPLEX: Homeownership is &quot;good for the community&quot; because owners care more about schools and maintaining the neighborhood. Unfortunately, our government thinks if something's good, it ought to require it...or at least subsidize it. And so it does. Now the government owns or guarantees 85% of America's mortgages and approves mortgages backed by down payments as low as 3%. America is on the road to another housing bubble, and crash that will follow.\n\nAIRBNB: Lots of people love the new home-sharing companies like Roomarama and Airbnb. Airbnb has more than 6 million users. But whenever there's a new idea, control freaks always say &quot;You've gotta stop that!&quot;\n\nGENTRIFICATION: Liberals object to gentrification, and so many other changes that make life better for the poor.\n\nTINY HOMES: Tiny homes like the ones in Washington DC are illegal if someone tries to move in. (My guest does live in one).\n\nHOMELESSNESS: Homelessness is a big problem, but it's solvable, say politicians. Government will provide affordable housing. And free housing for the truly needy. It's not working.\n\nMY TAKE: Affordable housing is a good thing, but politicians who yammer the most about it are often the ones who do the most to keep us from having it. They pass endless zoning rules, safety rules, and anti-discrimination regulations. That's why housing is expensive. It's not because of greedy landlords or homebuilders. It's because of politicians.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.03.27.Home.Sweet.Home.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 347 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 15s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 176 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 15s\nBit rate                                 : 1 038 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 345 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.135 fps\nOriginal frame rate                      : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 5.994 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.204\nStream size                              : 306 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1345 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 15s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.8 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be420a946f501c2e4006a8057f96116d1f09acc0","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.03.27.Home.Sweet.Home.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be420a946f501c2e4006a8057f96116d1f09acc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,66,10,148,111,80,28,46,64,6,168,5,127,150,17,109,31,9,172,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
