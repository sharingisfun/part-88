If they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring the money by Wednesday, Mr. Hammer will sell Old Charlie to the cat-food factory.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“They can make that no-good horse into food for dogs and cats!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Mr. Hammer.\n\nTwenty-five dollars is a lot of money.

Chapter link testing for both file types were carried out using Calibre for PC, Moon+ Reader and Aldiko for Android for the epub file. For the mobi file I used Kindle for both PC and Android and Mobipocket Reader for PC. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1e6daaf6bfa28c811105caa9cc81fb653029d1","amp;dn":"Old+Charlie+ebook+by+Clyde+Bulla+epub+mobi+Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1e6daaf6bfa28c811105caa9cc81fb653029d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,30,109,170,246,191,162,140,129,17,5,202,169,204,129,251,101,48,41,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
