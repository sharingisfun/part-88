(hah) For seven days I will post 1 Stossel episode. Ending next week on Thursday with the new episode. If I've counted right this will catch us up. There should be more episodes but Stossel has skipped a few weeks over the last couple months. \n\nSCHEDULE:\nFriday - Combating Terror\nSaturday - They're Coming To America\nSunday - Breaking... News?\nMonday - Big Brother\nTuesday - Crapitalism (Higher quality copy.)\nWednesday - Let Us Experiment\nThursday - Title yet to be announced.\n\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE\n--------------\nBRREAKING... NEWS?\n\nMEDIA BIAS: When I began my career as a consumer reporter, I had an obvious agenda: Businesses cheat consumers! Government must regulate them!\n\nCENSORSHIP AT CBS: Investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson has a similar story. She explains why she left CBS after it became &quot;harder and harder to get stories on television&quot; that criticized this government and &quot;any powers that be.&quot;\n\nIS STOSSEL BIASED?: Years ago, journalist Howard Kurtz criticized me for not being objective. I said it's impossible for any journalist to be completely objective. Now that Howard Kurtz is on Fox, we debate again.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVITY MYTH: Andrew Kirell of Mediaite.com says, &quot;every journalist has a point of view and they don't just magically check it the minute they walk in the newsroom door.&quot;\n\nNEW MEDIA: Reason TV's Remy Munasifi uses music videos and parodies to complain about things like politicians' spending. One of his latest parodies highlights the scandal surrounding the VA hospitals. Munasifi discusses his videos, which have gone viral on YouTube.\n\nRETRO REPORT: It's great there's a new media organization called Retro Report, which reveals media hype of the past (&quot;crack babies,&quot; America's landfill &quot;crisis,&quot; the &quot;superpredator,&quot; etc.) and corrects stories everyone in the media got wrong. I discuss the new show with its executive producer, Kyra Darnton.\n\nREAL OR FAKE?: Sometimes people in the media say things that are so bizarre, you'd think they were made up. Kennedy of The Independents quizzes FoxBusiness.com's Kate Rogers, Fox Business host Charles Payne and me to see if any of us can tell which quotes are real, and which were made up by my staff.\n\nMY TAKE: I used to report on lots of scares. CBS even ran an ad for me where someone called me a &quot;guardian angel.&quot;\n\nThat's bunk. The only guardian angel is a free and open society. That's what allows innovation, gives people longer lives, and lifts billions out of poverty. But these gradual improvements aren't newsworthy. Scares and disaster make the news.\n\nNews is broken not just because we're biased but because most good and important news happens slowly.\n\nfoxbusiness[.]com/on-air/stossel/blog/2014/07/10/breaking-news-9pm-et-fbn\n\n\nINFO\n----\nI ripped this using some cheap Diamond dongle. Ripped using EZ Ripper to their &quot;DVD standard&quot;. Cut into parts to remove commercials using AVIDemux and then joined those files. Using that same tool I then convert using MPEG4 AVC (x264) &amp; AAC (Faac) with a file limitation of 350mb, remove the black bars, and resize to 720x404.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Stossel.2014.07.10.Breaking.News.WS.WEB-DL.x264.XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 19s \nOverall bit rate : 1 187 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4901202e2109057a6779&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 19s \nBit rate : 1 048 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Constant \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.120 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1048 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 19s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.8 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc7c5294bcff460335f55e115488679bfa3476a","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.07.10.Breaking.News.WS.WEB-DL.x264.XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc7c5294bcff460335f55e115488679bfa3476a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,199,197,41,75,207,244,96,51,95,85,225,21,72,134,121,191,163,71,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
