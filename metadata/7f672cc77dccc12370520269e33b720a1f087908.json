This fast-paced genre-bending mix of strategy defense and action gameplay brings four unique toy factions . Lead from the strategic level, placing and upgrading turrets, or take direct command of your units and heroes to deliver assaults. With 19 unique maps to conquer, four armies to master, fun multiplayer modes that support up to four players, and new challenges being added every seven days with the new Weekly War Mode, Toy Soldiers: War Chest will keep you coming back for more! \n\nKaiser, Starbright, Phantom and Dark Lord Armies \nThere are four different armies to command, each with different strengths, play styles and personalities. Kaiser returns with his disciplined WWI-era German forces, and Starbright brings her cuddly army of rainbow Unicorns, teddy bears and fairies. On the other side of the spectrum is Dark Lord, a villainous tactician who commands a supernatural faction made from men, monsters, and dragons. Hailing from the future, Phantom and her Ghost Company are highly skilled in the art of guerrilla warfare and are armed with deadly technology. \n\nWeekly War \nThe battle continues with new challenge maps added every week. Complete all five missions within the seven days and earn rewards such as new units, upgrades and currency to build your every-growing army. \n\nMultiplayer Multiplied \nFind out in multiplayer by taking on your friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ armies in heated 1v1 competition. Take turns protecting your toy box and preparing waves of different enemies for the best attack. If you would rather join up with your bestie and take on other teams of toys in the new 2v2 mode, plan a playdate! \n\nCooperative and Couch Play \nTeam up with a friend to play any of the main campaign, weekly war, survival, or multiplayer maps together! You can play split screen on the same console or invite your friends and play online.\n\nSystem Requirements\nMINIMUM: \nOS: Windows 8.1 64 Bit, Windows 8 64 Bit, Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1 \nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz (4 CPUs) / AMD Phenom 9850 Quad-Core Processor (4 CPUs) @ 2.5GHz \nMemory: 4 GB RAM \nGraphics: NVIDIA 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB (DX 10, 10.1, 11) \nDirectX: Version 11 \nHard Drive: 10 GB available space \nSound Card: 100% DirectX 11 Compliant Sound Card \nAdditional Notes: Broadband connection and service required for multiplayer mode\n\nRECOMMENDED: \nOS: Windows 8.1 64 Bit, Windows 8 64 Bit, Windows 7 64 Bit Service Pack 1 \nProcessor: Intel Core i5 3470 @ 3.2GHz (4 CPUs) / AMD X8 FX-8350 @ 4GHz (8 CPUs) \nMemory: 8 GB RAM \nGraphics: NVIDIA GTX 660 2GB / AMD HD 7870 2GB \nDirectX: Version 11 \nHard Drive: 10 GB available space \nSound Card: 100% DirectX 11 Compliant Sound Card \nAdditional Notes: Broadband connection and service required for multiplayer mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f672cc77dccc12370520269e33b720a1f087908","amp;dn":"Toy.Soldiers.War.Chest.Hall.Of.Fame.Edition-ALI213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f672cc77dccc12370520269e33b720a1f087908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,103,44,199,125,204,193,35,112,82,2,105,227,59,114,10,31,8,121,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
