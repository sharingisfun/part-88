When he comes up with an idea to make a self conscious robot named Chappie to protect better, his higher-ups disapprove it. Nonetheless, he makes it and when the company finds out, scraps the robot. When 2 small time criminals planning a $200 million heist find Chappie, they kidnap Deon and force him to program Chappie to assist them in their heist. When power-corrupted military general Vincent (Hugh Jackman) finds out, he rallies all forces to stop Chappie, at any cost that leads to an monumental showdown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9959d702e7640fc18ee13837825b4712127a9257","amp;dn":"Chappie+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9959d702e7640fc18ee13837825b4712127a9257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,89,215,2,231,100,15,193,142,225,56,55,130,91,71,18,18,122,146,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
