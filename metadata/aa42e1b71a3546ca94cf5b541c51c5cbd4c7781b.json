This is for the pc ONLY.\n\nThis torrent contains GMod 11 and GMod 12. These are steam sourcemods. There is no crack included. Below is a list of changes:\n\n- Renamed the game folders to garrysmod11   and   garrysmod12\n\n- Added CS:S content to GMod 12 (sound files are there but are improperly installed)\n\n- Added some addons to GMod 12\n\n- Renamed the game names in the gameinfo.txt\n\n\n- Added join links to my community servers to the game main menu\n\n\nPlease note that this REQUIRES steam to work. And I will not help if you crack this.\n\nTo run this game on steam you need the Source SDK Base 2007 installed as well as a source game. Please note the content from other games (except the hl2 base stuff) will not work as it no longer uses gcf format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa42e1b71a3546ca94cf5b541c51c5cbd4c7781b","amp;dn":"Garry%27s+Mod+12+and+Garry%27s+Mod+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa42e1b71a3546ca94cf5b541c51c5cbd4c7781b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,66,225,183,26,53,70,202,148,207,91,84,28,81,197,203,212,199,120,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
