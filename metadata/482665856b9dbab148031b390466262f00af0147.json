You need to click the tiny padlock icon in the lower right corner of the screen (under the zoom buttons) to turn the icons back on. You need to this everytime the game starts, it's a minor pain, but there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nChanges are made to the following files, so will clash with any other mods that also change them: \ninterfacesmenubar.gui \ninterfacesmapmode_more.gui \ninterfacesmapmode_more.gfx \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482665856b9dbab148031b390466262f00af0147","amp;dn":"MapModeButtons+-+Europa+Universalis+IV+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482665856b9dbab148031b390466262f00af0147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,38,101,133,107,157,186,177,72,3,27,57,4,102,38,47,0,175,1,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
