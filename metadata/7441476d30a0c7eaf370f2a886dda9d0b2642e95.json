Combining brutal death metal, atmospheric black metal, and a heap of progressive tendencies, Exhausted Prayer has carved itself deeply into the annals of extreme metal on the West Coast.\n\nThe band continues to write, record, and perform live in both their hometown of Los Angeles, and wherever they can find a place to crash and a vegan meal.\n\n\nInfluences:\n\nEnslaved, At the Gates, Opeth, Cryptopsy.\n\n\n\nQuote:\nThe third full-length from LA's progressive extreme metal iconoclasts. Focusing on their usual themes of desperation and hopelessness, the epic songwriting and triple vocal assault will leave you utterly Ruined.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\nExhausted Prayer once again summon the technical intensity of Death Metal and the sullen, twisted atmosphere of Black Metal while deftly weaving influences as wide ranging as classical, jazz, world music, and progressive rock.\n\n&quot;Ruined&quot; reveals a greater maturity and variety of moods, channeling desperation and resentment wrought by the destructive ideologies of religion, capitalism, and general self-serving ignorance.\n1.
