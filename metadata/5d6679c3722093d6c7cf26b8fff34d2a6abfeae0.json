All this made their series of shared shows in November 2007 an event, albeit a low-key one. King and Taylor embrace their classics -- it seems that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a hit missed between the two of them -- and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genuine warmth to the whole show thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite appealing. Perhaps there are no surprises here, but any shock would have run counter to the whole spirit of the evening: this is about basking in both nostalgia and friendship, and if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on the same wave as the musicians, Live at the Troubadour is enjoyable. \n\n\nGenre................: Folk Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Hear Music\nIncluded.............:Covers, auCDtect, Cue, Log\n\n\n01.Blossom\n02.So Far Away\n03.Machine Gun Kelly\n04.Carolina In My Mind\n05.It's Too Late\n06.Smackwater Jack\n07.Something In The Way She Moves\n08.Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n09.Country Road\n10.Fire And Rain\n11.Sweet Baby James\n12.I Feel The Earth Move\n13.You've Got A Friend\n14.Up On The Roof\n15.You Can Close Your Eyes\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d6679c3722093d6c7cf26b8fff34d2a6abfeae0","amp;dn":"Carole+King+%2B+James+Taylor+Live+At+The+Troubadour+%282010%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d6679c3722093d6c7cf26b8fff34d2a6abfeae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,102,121,195,114,32,147,214,199,207,38,184,255,243,77,42,106,191,234,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
