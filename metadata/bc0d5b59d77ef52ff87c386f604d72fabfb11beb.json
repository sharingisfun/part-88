As a child Eunsun loved her country...despite her school field trips to public executions, daily self-criticism sessions, and the increasing gnaw of hunger as the country-wide famine escalated.\n\nBy the time she was eleven years old, Eunsun's father and grandparents had died of starvation, and Eunsun was in danger of the same. Finally, her mother decided to escape North Korea with Eunsun and her sister, not knowing that they were embarking on a journey that would take them nine long years to complete. Before finally reaching South Korea and freedom, Eunsun and her family would live homeless, fall into the hands of Chinese human traffickers, survive a North Korean labor camp, and cross the deserts of Mongolia on foot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc0d5b59d77ef52ff87c386f604d72fabfb11beb","amp;dn":"A+Thousand+Miles+to+Freedom%3A+My+Escape+from+North+Korea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc0d5b59d77ef52ff87c386f604d72fabfb11beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,13,91,89,215,126,245,47,248,124,56,111,96,77,114,250,191,177,27,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
