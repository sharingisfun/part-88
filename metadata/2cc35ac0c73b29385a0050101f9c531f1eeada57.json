The music on the album is melodic and groove based and often plays around with repetition in order to emphasise and dramatize change when and if it finally occurs. \n\nInspired by a world heritage of rhythms and sounds found in African, Cuban, Brazillian, Middle Eastern, Eastern European folk and traditional music, Phronesis strive to create original and meditative soundscapes fusing these rhythms with lyrical and atmospheric contributions from the respective members of the group.\n\nThe material comprises entirely of Hoiby originals and reveals him to be an excellent writer with an unfailing ear for a good tune. HoibyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way with a melody is matched by his way with a groove and the style in which he mixes the two together engages the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention throughout the whole album. With eleven relatively short tracks no idea is allowed to outstay itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s welcome.\n\nAlthough Hoiby leads from the bass this is ostensibly a piano trio and the mood varies from ECM style lyricism through to more rhythmic, groove led pieces in the style of EST (minus the electronics) or the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Neil Cowley Trio.\n\nThe opening Ã¢â‚¬Å“UntitledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and its later reprise have a pastoral air that nods in the direction of ECM. However even here HoibyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge, singing bass sound hints at something more groove orientated.\n\nThe skittering, energetic title track echoes the intensity of CowleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach whereas Ã¢â‚¬Å“MelodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ combines melody and groove in the manner of EST.\n\nHowever these comparisons are merely convenient reference points. Hoiby is no mere copyist and his writing is consistently interesting throughout. Leading from the bass he is able to put his own stamp on the music. There is a real collective spirit within the group and each member makes a vital contribution to the overall sound.\n\nHoibyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous bass tone and agile finger work makes him both a vital rhythmic component and an important soloist, the closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“NaÃƒÂ¯ve TuneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ being a particular highlight. Appropriately he is at the very core of the music.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Untitled#1\n02 - Organic Warfare\n03 - French\n04 - Melody\n05 - Smoking The Camel\n06 - Seven For Samba\n07 - Three Bar Loop\n08 - Mournful\n09 - '4 Now'\n10 - Untitled#2\n11 - Naive Tune\n\n*2007 Loop Records | LOOP 1003\n\nAll compositions by JASPER HÃƒËœIBY\nRecorded at Sincere Studios, Copenhagen, Denmark\nEngineered, mixed and mastered by August Wanngren\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJASPER HÃƒËœIBY double bass\nMAGNUS HJORTH piano\nANTON EGER drums\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\n\n\n\nSome Phronesis Album's...\n\n\nPhronesis - Green Delay (2009) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11031400/Phronesis_-_Green_Delay_%282009%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11031400/Phronesis_-_Green_Delay_%282009%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPhronesis - Alive (2010) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11043328/Phronesis_-_Alive_%282010%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11043328/Phronesis_-_Alive_%282010%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPhronesis - Walking Dark (2012) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11048926/Phronesis_-__Walking_Dark_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11048926/Phronesis_-__Walking_Dark_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPhronesis - Life To Everything (2014) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.vg/torrent/11054525/Phronesis_-_Life_To_Everything_%282014%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.vg/torrent/11054525/Phronesis_-_Life_To_Everything_%282014%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cc35ac0c73b29385a0050101f9c531f1eeada57","amp;dn":"Phronesis+-+Organic+Warfare+%282007%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cc35ac0c73b29385a0050101f9c531f1eeada57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,195,90,192,199,59,41,56,90,0,80,16,31,156,83,31,30,234,218,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
