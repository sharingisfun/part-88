Some really good rap.  Roots of rap.  Roots of female rap/hip hop.\n\nEpidemic crack addiction and violence was well established coast to coast in the USA by this time.  Gangster rap and even more violence saturated the 90's.  Keep that in mind when listening to the lyrics.  In fact, download a copy of the movie Boyz N The Hood and see for yourself.\n\n- Big Papi[/b]\n\n\n[quote=&quot;By Peter Edey&quot;]This is THE definitive album of all time showcasing the incredible talent of being a hip hop MC. MC Lyte is without any doubt one of the greatest MCs of all time. At a time when Big Daddy Kane was heating up the scene with tracks like RAW, MC Lyte was entertaining hip hop audiences in 1989 with tracks on 'Eyes On This' such as 'Stop, Look, Listen'. 'Stop, Look, Listen', produced by King Of Chill, is a perfect piece of hip hop mastery. The beat makes your head automatically bob. A classic by all means. \n\nOther tracks like 'Cappucino', produced by Marley Marl, display MC Lyte's ability to paint a vivid picture with words alone. 'Cha Cha Cha', also produced by King Of Chill, is poetry in motion. I saw MC Lyte perform some of these tracks at the 'Sisters In The Name Of Rap' concert, and I have to say that she sounds even better live. \n\nThis is a rare and remarkable asset though. This entire album is a listen, you can play it from start to finish. Every track on 'Eyes On This' can easily hold its own. This is a must-have for any hip hop lover. Peace to MC Lyte, the Audio Two - Milk &amp; Gizmo, King Of Chill, Pee MD, Grand Puba Maxwell, DJ Doc and Marley Marl.[/quote]\n\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/20/Folder0c276.md.jpg[/img]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 MC Lyte - Eyes on This (FPM 91304)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: MC Lyte\nAlbum................: Eyes on This (FPM 91304)\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 54 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
