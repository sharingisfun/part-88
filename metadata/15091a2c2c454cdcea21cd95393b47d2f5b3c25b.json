Meanwhile, the saboteur Raul Nimon kills Dr. Alfred Stiles and plants a nuclear bomb with a timing device in the phase synchronizer console; however, the security seals all the exit and Nimon escapes through the time tunnel that is fixed in Doug and Tony. General Kirk orders the scientists to capture Nimon and discover where the bomb is hidden. However the tunnel is out of control and sends the trio to one million years in the future in a society organized like a beehive. However Nimon had arrived ten years before and is building a time machine trying to return to the present days. When the time tunnel personnel tries to transfer the trio to another time, they accidentally brings the soldier Vokar and the worker Zee together to one million years BC. The scientists try to force Nimon to tell where the nuclear device was planted in the last chance to save his friends and themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15091a2c2c454cdcea21cd95393b47d2f5b3c25b","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+Chase+Through+Time+Ep.+24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15091a2c2c454cdcea21cd95393b47d2f5b3c25b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,9,26,44,44,69,76,220,234,33,205,149,57,59,71,210,245,179,194,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
