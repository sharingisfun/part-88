Given that Philandrist is MIA I will start uploading these. I've got every episode that hasn't been posted EXCEPT Aug. 27th and 29th. If anyone has these episodes on the DVR please get a hold of me. Even it it's like a cellphone video. I'd be happy to get those in any quality as I didn't get a chance to see them.\n\nAlso we're going to have to get a second stringer at some point. My DVR is unreliable. There's a pretty good chance I wont be able to cap every single episode. If someone out there could help me with that I'm sure we'd all be grateful.\n\nOne more note. No after show tonight. This episode is unique as our bombing campaign in Syria started while the episode was live. No commercial breaks toward the end. 50 minute episode as opposed to the 41 it is normally. So they skipped the after show.\n\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE INDEPENDENTS\n---------------------------\nTonight's live episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three hours later) is filled with hot people-on-climate action. Reacting to today's #Flood Wall Street climate-change protest against evil rich corporations are Party Panelists John Tierney (New York Times science writer) and Ellison Barber (Washington Free Beacon writer). The two will also discuss ISIS's latest threat to kill the &quot;spiteful, dirty&quot; French, and the crazy case of the White House fence-jumper (and overreaction thereof).\n\nWe're also not done with ISIS; The Interpreter's Michael Weiss will talk about Turkey's pivotal and contested role in the new war-on-those-guys, and Wall Street Journal multimedia explainer Jason Bellini will use his fancy tools to break down just who these ISIS guys are and how they function. Finally, I'll have some words about Lois Lerner's vomit-inducing interview with Politico.\n\n**EDIT BY REIVE** A lot of this information is wrong. Second half of the show is breaking news and bumped their planned show. **EDIT BY REIVE**\n\nreason[.]com/blog/2014/09/22/tonight-on-the-independents-ron-bailey-a\n\n\n\nINFO\n----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : H:MediaBrianTelevisionThe IndependentsThe Independents 2014The.Independents.2014.09.22.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 361 MiB \nDuration : 51mn 30s \nOverall bit rate : 980 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ac2e3ede2cac6b9a4ba&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 51mn 30s \nBit rate : 841 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.096 \nStream size : 310 MiB (86%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=841 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 51mn 30s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 47.1 MiB (13%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aa2599130fbf4b89016899cb4d6b15b859a0cdc","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.09.22.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aa2599130fbf4b89016899cb4d6b15b859a0cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,162,89,145,48,251,244,184,144,22,137,156,180,214,177,91,133,154,12,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
