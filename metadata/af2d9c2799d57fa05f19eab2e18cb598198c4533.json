For anyone willing to help me seed any albums which they directly downloaded from Christian Tunes, I would greatly appreciate your help.  If you're not sure how, it's pretty simple ... (1) create a folder called &quot;2014 - The Year In Christian Music (Bundle 51)&quot; in the same folder where your torrents are usually downloaded to.  (2) copy and paste your downloaded music into that folder.  (3) then download the torrent as you normally would.  Your torrent client will recognize that you already have some of these albums, and instead of a downloader, you will be recognized as an uploader for those albums you just copied over.\n\nThere are 32 titles in today's bundle...\n\n * Ace Boogie - 2014 - I Live For This\n * Ace Boogie - 2014 - I Live For This - Single\n * Adam And Kizzie - 2014 - The Book Of EEDO, Vol 2\n * Adia - 2014 - Behind Enemy Lines\n * Andrew De Silva - 2014 - Now That I Believe EP\n * Andrew Ehrenzeller - 2014 - Children Of Promise\n * Antioch Live - 2014 - It Is Finished\n * Arkansas Gospel Music Heritage - 2014 - Celebration Of Gospel Music In Arkansas\n * Austin Adamec - 2014 - Chains Break - Single\n * Ayiesha Woods - 2014 - It's Time\n * B-Free - 2014 - Wild Rebel - Single\n * Big Dismal - 2014 - Bringing Me Home - Single\n * Bizzle - 2014 - Cried Out - Single\n * Bluetree - 2014 - Worship And Justice\n * Boiling Point - 2014 - More\n * Brian Weaver - 2014 - In Motion\n * Bringing Home - 2014 - Bringing Home EP\n * Canon - 2014 - Trippen - Single\n * Cathedrals - 2014 - Family Reunion\n * Celldweller - 2014 - End Of An Empire - Chapter 01- Time\n * Certified Truth - 2014 - The EP\n * Charles Goose - 2014 - Charles Goose EP\n * Chow - 2014 - Be Thou My Vision - Single\n * Chozyn Disyple - 2014 - Freedom Of Speech\n * Climbing Blind - 2014 - Burn\n * Colossus - 2014 - Badlands\n * Colton Dixon - 2014 - Anchor\n * Corey Strong - 2014 - Believer EP\n * Crossing, The - 2014 - One\n * Dae Lee - 2014 - Reflect EP\n * Danton Whitley - 2014 - Living Unlocked, Vol 1\n * Darris Sneed - 2014 - Moments\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts, September 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af2d9c2799d57fa05f19eab2e18cb598198c4533","amp;dn":"2014+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+51%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af2d9c2799d57fa05f19eab2e18cb598198c4533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,45,156,39,153,213,127,160,95,25,234,178,225,140,181,152,25,140,69,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
