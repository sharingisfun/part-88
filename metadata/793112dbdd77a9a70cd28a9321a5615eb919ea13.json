Letter Composed During a Lull in the Fighting captures the many moments that comprise a soldier's life: driving down the Texas highway; waiting for the unknown in the dry Iraq heat; writing a love letter; listening to a mother recount her dreams. Written with evocative language and discernment, Powers's poetry strives to make sense of the war and its echoes through human experience.\nJust as The Yellow Birds was hailed as the &quot;first literary masterpiece produced by the Iraq war,&quot; this collection will make its mark as a powerful, enduring work (Los Angeles Times).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793112dbdd77a9a70cd28a9321a5615eb919ea13","amp;dn":"Letter+Composed+During+a+Lull+in+the+Fighting-+Poems+by+Kevin+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793112dbdd77a9a70cd28a9321a5615eb919ea13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,49,18,219,221,119,169,167,12,210,138,147,33,165,97,94,185,25,234,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
