But if she'd secretly loved him, those feelings had died one bright summer morning, when a reckless wager left Annabelle with terrifying injuries. Alec had abandoned her without a backwards glance.\nHardly the actions of a hero. \nBut Alec has never forgotten her, despite his vow to stay away. There is more to that long-ago day than Annabelle knows, and shocking lies have distorted the past. Can he uncover its painful truths, and still keep his distance from the stunning beauty? Can he deny his forbidden desire, even as it flares again between them, hotter than ever?\n\nNumber of pages: 298\n\nISBN13: 9781440581588\n\nISBN10: 1440581584\n\nFormat: EPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03b5ad365bafb14fbaa6691c29db715895f465c","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Wager+by+Julie+LeMense+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03b5ad365bafb14fbaa6691c29db715895f465c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,59,90,211,101,186,251,20,251,170,102,145,194,157,183,21,137,95,70,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
