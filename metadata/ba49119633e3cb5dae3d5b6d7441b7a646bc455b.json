Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - updated all keybindings for 40.13\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to v27.0\n - patched DFHack box select issue\n - updated exportlegends script, handles all site maps too\n - updated TwbT to v5.12; which includes a number of changes:\n    - fixes occasional crash and issues with acting above a z-level\n    - text now uses 8x12 ASCII, with 16x16 graphical map tiles\n    - print_mode must be set to &quot;TWBT&quot;; only an issue if you change it\n    - standard zoom controls now only resize text (ie not map tiles)\n    - added map-zoom controls ctrl-P, ctrl-O\n\nMD5:  9F032A1736030FAE95080CD420AA5094","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba49119633e3cb5dae3d5b6d7441b7a646bc455b","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_13+Starter+Pack+r3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba49119633e3cb5dae3d5b6d7441b7a646bc455b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,73,17,150,51,227,203,93,174,61,91,109,116,65,183,166,70,188,69,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
