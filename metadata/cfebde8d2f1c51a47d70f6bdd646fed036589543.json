Feared by explorers, revered by the Inuit, and beloved by zoo goers everywhere, polar bears are a symbol for the harsh beauty and muscular grace of the Arctic. Today, as global warming threatens the ice caps' integrity, the polar bear has also come to symbolize the peril that faces all life on earth as a result of harmful human practices. Here, the acclaimed science writer Richard Ellis offers an impassioned and moving statement on behalf of polar bearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and all they stand for. Ellis gives a vivid and brilliantly articulated picture of earth's largest land predatorsÃ¢â‚¬â€including their hunting, mating, and hibernation habits. Polar bears are exceptionally well suited for huntingÃ¢â‚¬â€especially when it comes to ringed seals, their favorite prey, which they can smell from more than a mile away. But as the ice melts in the Arctic, the ability of polar bears to find food diminishes in spite of their incredible physical capacities. Some bears will vainly take to the water in search of ice on which to hunt, and many of them swim until they drown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfebde8d2f1c51a47d70f6bdd646fed036589543","amp;dn":"On+Thin+Ice%3A+The+Changing+World+of+the+Polar+Bear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfebde8d2f1c51a47d70f6bdd646fed036589543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,235,222,141,47,28,81,164,125,112,246,189,214,70,254,208,54,88,149,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
