You've\nfound a torrent for a game that only includes the game files\nAND NOTHING ELSE!\n\nThis means NO Bullshit Packaged Installers that also install a\nbunch of adware and potentially other types of malware onto your\ncomputer as well! If you're like me, then you absolutely HATE\nwhen a torrent uploader/exploiter puts all of the required game\nfiles into one single installer file, and also packages adware\ninstallers to autorun once the installation is complete! Chances\nare you don't actually know how to remove these pieces of malware \nonce they are installed, and that's what these packagers thrive on!\nDon't fall for some bullshit scam off of those fake websites telling\nyou to download their &quot;Auto Adware Scanners&quot; or something else that\ndoesn't work, by not getting the adware IN THE FIRST PLACE! That's\nwhy I've taken the time to acquire the game files themselves, or the\nORIGINAL Installer, and put them in a versatile Archive that anyone \nwith a copy of WinRAR or 7-Zipcan open, and i've also made sure \nNO ADWARE or other types of malware or unwanted files are packaged \nwith it!\n\nInstallation:\n==================\nInstallation is Simple!\nJust copy the folder &quot;Hacknet&quot; from this archive, into &quot;C:Program Files (x86)&quot; or anywhere else you might want it (some games need to go to this\nspecified directory however), and PLAY!\n\nSystem Requirements (MAKE SURE YOUR SYSTEM MEETS OR EXCEEDS THESE):\n=========================================================\nMinimum:\n\tOS: Windows XP\n\tProcessor: 2.0 GHz\n\tMemory: 512 MB RAM\n\tGraphics: GeForce 8800 or RadeonÃ‚Â® HD4800 series, 512 MB of memory\n\tHard Drive: 100 MB available space \n\nGame Description (FROM STEAM):\n===============================\nHacknet is an immersive, terminal-based hacking simulator for PC. Dive down a rabbit hoIe as you follow the instructions of a recently deceased hacker, whose death may not have been the accident the media reports. Using old school command prompts and real hacking processes, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve the mystery with minimal hand-holding and a rich world full of secrets to explore.\n\nBit, a hacker responsible for creating the most invasive security system on the planet, is dead. When he fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to a lone user. As that user, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to unravel the mystery and ensure that Hacknet-OS doesn't fall into the wrong hands.\n\nExploring the volatile nature of personal privacy, the prevalence of corporate greed, and the hidden powers of hackers on the internet, Hacknet delivers a true hacking simulation, while offering a support system that allows total beginners get a grasp of the real-world applications and commands found throughout the game.\n\n  ___          _   _  _         _   _           \n | _ ___ __ _| | | || |__ _ __| |_(_)_ _  __ _ \n |   / -_) _` | | | __ / _` / _| / / | ' / _` |\n |_|______,_|_| |_||___,___|___|_||___, |\n                                          |___/ \n\nBased on actual UNIX commands, Hacknet focuses on real hacking, not the Hollywood-style version of it.
