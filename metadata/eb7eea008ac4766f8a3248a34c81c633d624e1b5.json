Griffin (NREL, 1996).pdf\n\nThis study focuses on the use of vortex generators (VGs) for performance augmentation of the stall-regulated AWT-26 wind turbine. The goal was to design a VG array which would increase annual energy production (AEP) by increasing power output at moderate wind speeds, without adversely affecting the loads or stall-regulation performance of the turbine. While the present work did not lead to improved AEP for the AWT-26 turbine, it does provide insight into performance augmentation of wind turbines with VGs. The safe design of a VG array for a stall-regulated turbine has been demonstrated, and several issues involving optimal performance with VGs have been identified and addressed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7eea008ac4766f8a3248a34c81c633d624e1b5","amp;dn":"Investigation+of+Vortex+Generators+For+Augmentation+of+Wind+Turb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7eea008ac4766f8a3248a34c81c633d624e1b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,126,234,0,138,196,118,111,138,50,72,163,76,129,198,51,214,36,225,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
