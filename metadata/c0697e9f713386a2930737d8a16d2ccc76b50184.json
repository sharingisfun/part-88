While the album earned KOD comparisons to bands like Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Chameleons, the guitar soundscapes created by Julian Swales and the passionate lyrics and vocal delivery from Patrick Fitzgerald gave Kitchens of Distinction their own signature sound. The album also maintains a punkier sound than to be featured on the band's later albums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0697e9f713386a2930737d8a16d2ccc76b50184","amp;dn":"Kitchens+of+Distinction+-+1989+-+Love+Is+Hell+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0697e9f713386a2930737d8a16d2ccc76b50184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,105,126,159,113,51,134,162,147,7,55,216,161,109,44,204,118,181,1,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
