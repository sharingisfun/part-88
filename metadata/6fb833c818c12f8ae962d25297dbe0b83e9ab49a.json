Advances in Biorefineries provides a comprehensive overview of biorefining processing techniques and technologies, and the biofuels and other materials produced.\n\nPart one focuses on methods of optimizing the biorefining process and assessing its environmental and economic impact. It also looks at current and developing technologies for producing value-added materials. Part two goes on to explore these materials with a focus on biofuels and other value-added products. It considers the properties, limitations, and practical applications of these products and how they can be used to meet the increasing demand for renewable and sustainable fuels as an alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nAdvances in Biorefineries is a vital reference for biorefinery/process engineers, industrial biochemists/chemists, biomass/waste scientists and researchers and academics in the field.\n\nA comprehensive and systematic reference on the advanced biomass recovery and conversion processes used in biorefineries\nReviews developments in biorefining processes\nDiscusses the wide range of value-added products from biorefineries, from biofuel to biolubricants and bioadhesives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb833c818c12f8ae962d25297dbe0b83e9ab49a","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Biorefineries+-+Biomass+and+Waste+Supply+Chain+Explo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb833c818c12f8ae962d25297dbe0b83e9ab49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,184,51,200,24,193,47,138,233,98,210,82,151,219,224,184,62,154,180,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
