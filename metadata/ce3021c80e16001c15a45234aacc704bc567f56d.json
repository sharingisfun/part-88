Told through the eyes of protagonist Cathy Grant, the comics detail the adventures of a Peace Corps volunteer in the Central African Republic in the mid-1980s.[1] The work explores why so much effort by so many volunteers wrought so little change. Later stories delve into the reign of the mad dictator Jean-BÃƒÂ©del Bokassa.\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3021c80e16001c15a45234aacc704bc567f56d","amp;dn":"+Tales+From+the+Heart+of+Africa%3A+Temporary+Natives+%28Rumor-Epic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3021c80e16001c15a45234aacc704bc567f56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,48,33,200,14,22,0,28,21,164,82,52,170,204,112,75,197,103,245,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
