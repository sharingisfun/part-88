Its title is an amalgamation of the terms 'Little England' and 'Great Britain'. It made its debut on BBC Radio 4 in 2001, running for two short series of five and four half-hour episodes respectively.  \n\nMany of the characters on the show have their own often-repeated catchphrases. Many have become well-known in the U.K., and it has gained a cult following.\n\n\nThe format of the show is a compilation of short sketches featuring familiar characters, linked by narration from Tom Baker (most famous as the Fourth Doctor on Doctor Who). The voiceovers take a wry look at Britain, with comically absurd statements on the nation's character, such as, &quot;Britain ... We've had running water for over 10 years,an underground tunnel linking us to Peru, and we invented the cat&quot; or, &quot;Unlike other countries, Britain has people of two genders: women and men.&quot;\n\nThe style of Little Britain has evolved over the years. The series consist of surreal concepts taken to logical extremes (such as the witch employing contractors to build her gingerbread house or the man leaving increasingly bizarre messages on his answering machine.) The sketches that caught the public's imagination, however, tended to be those which gave rise to memorable catchphrases and memes.\n\ncast:\n\nMatt Lucas\nDavid Walliams\nJean Ainslie\nTom Baker\nSamantha Power\nPaul Putner\n\n\nLittle Britain - S01 - E00 - Pilot Episode\nLittle Britain - S01 - E01\nLittle Britain - S01 - E02\nLittle Britain - S01 - E03\nLittle Britain - S01 - E04\n\nLittle Britain - S02 - E01\nLittle Britain - S02 - E02\nLittle Britain - S02 - E03\nLittle Britain - S02 - E04\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8b116188eea942be6eb46ebce95fe7a643a002","amp;dn":"Little+Britain+-+S01+And+02+-+Radio+Series+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8b116188eea942be6eb46ebce95fe7a643a002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,139,17,97,136,238,169,66,190,110,180,110,188,233,95,231,166,67,160,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
