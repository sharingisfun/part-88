This is the one to get. It boasts considerably better sound and a lengthier track list. The entirety of Evolution -- featuring the oft-sampled Top Ten R&amp;B hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScorpioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a grinding version of Led Zeppelin's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whole Lotta LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- is scattered throughout the sequence, while smart selections from the other three albums -- including the number 11 R&amp;B hit &quot;Taurus,&quot; &quot;Son of Scorpio,&quot; and &quot;Theme from Enter the Dragon&quot; -- take up the other half of the disc. Prime instrumental funk informed by acid rock, gutsy soul, and street-level jazz.\n\n01. Ride Sally Ride 03:11\n02. Can You Feel It 02:53\n03. Midnight Blue 02:47\n04. Scorpio 04:07\n05.
