The song also became a hit, peaking at #8 on UK charts, the 1996 remix by Roger Glover later appeared on the re-release of their 1971 album Fireball, the original version can be found on various Deep Purple compilations. The track was also released on the US edition of Fireball, in lieu of the UK version's track &quot;Demon's Eye&quot;.\n\nThe song was originally called &quot;Prostitute&quot;. Vocalist Ian Gillan introduced the song on Deep Purple in Concert: &quot;It was about a friend of ours who got mixed up with a very evil woman and it was a sad story. They got married in the end. And a few days after they got married, the lady died.&quot; In Wordography's section Gillan gives slightly different version of the song's history:\n\n\nI loved her in a strange post-adolescent-pre-adult way, but then so did quite a lot of other people. She loved them too and gave them good return for their money. I failed miserably when I tried to break her from the habib...she said it wasn't a habit, it was her life and what did I know anyway? I did get promoted from Wednesday morning trysts to Saturday evening dates (sort of). The fact is, this song is not about one woman...but a compilation of thrills and disappointments, and such a package can only be called Nancy. I grew up fast...the innocence died and, in the category...My Woman... all claims were relinquished.\n\nWhen Deep Purple performed the song live, Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore would play a guitar-vocal duel in the middle. This would always end with an extremely long, high-pitched scream from Gillan before the band returned to playing the original song. An example can be heard on the live album Made In Japan recorded in 1972.\n\n\nDeep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted its sound to hard rock in 1970, and in 2013 began exploring progressive metal. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-Seventies&quot;. They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the globe's loudest band&quot; for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide, including 8.5 million certified units in the US.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Kind_of_Woman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Kind_of_Woman&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/3mf68lu3n/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/3mf68lu3n/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8264kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:46\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
