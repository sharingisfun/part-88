The Great War is over, Prohibition is in full swing, the Depression still years away, and Newport, Rhode Island's glittering Ã¢â‚¬Å“summer cottagesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are inhabited by the gloriously rich families who built them.\n\nAttorney Adrian De la Noye is no stranger to Newport, having sheltered there during his misspent youth. Though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d prefer to forget the place, he returns to revise the will of a well-heeled client. Bennett Chapman's offspring have the usual concerns about their father's much-younger fiancÃƒÂ©e. But when they learn of the old widowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s firm belief that his first late wife, who Ã¢â‚¬Å“communicatesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ via sÃƒÂ©ance, has chosen the beautiful Catherine Walsh for him, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re shocked. And for Adrian, encountering Catherine in the last place he saw her decades ago proves to be a far greater surprise.\n\nStill, De la Noye is here to handle a will, and he fully intends to do soÃ¢â‚¬â€just as soon as he unearths every last secret, otherworldly or not, about the Chapmans, Catherine Walsh . . . and his own very fraught history.\n\nA skillful alchemy of social satire, dark humor, and finely drawn characters, Newport vividly brings to life the glitzy era of the 1920s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92aef60383add9e86b582cb085f536bc183c9a1f","amp;dn":"New+Port+-+Jill+Morrow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92aef60383add9e86b582cb085f536bc183c9a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,174,246,3,131,173,217,232,107,88,44,176,133,245,54,188,24,60,154,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
