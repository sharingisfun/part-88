Sandy Kane makes an appearance (for the love of god WHYYY???) to talk about nakedness in Time Square and her brushes with the law, Luis J. Gomez and Sean Donnelly take a seat and listen to Sandy continue on about getting raped by Phil Spector, almost doing drugs with Richard Pryor, the movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“Peaches Does Herself,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the documentary she plans on making. Sandy goes though some of the celebrities she fucked, Luis complains about getting bumped, Sandy (un) gracefully exits the broadcast, and they go on to discuss Sandy and her stories and talk about TargetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bathroom changes. After the guys have some more laughs at SandyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expense, they talk about Josh Ostrovsky (aka Fat Jew), joke thieves, bit services, the FCC now and then, exploring funny content, Ã¢â‚¬Å“To Catch a PredatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and questionable O&amp;A fans, doing kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shows, Ant recalls a few former jocks getting busted for kiddie shenanigans, Luis promises to get Ant high, KtC tells a few drunken cop stories, and they share ideas of how not to get arrested and watch a clip of Chris Rock explaining the law.\n\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc6aa9216c00afd4c2e1603e186402efb4e53fc","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-08-18+Vic+Minogna%2C+Luis+J.+Gomez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc6aa9216c00afd4c2e1603e186402efb4e53fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,198,170,146,22,192,10,253,76,46,22,3,225,134,64,46,251,78,83,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
