This is, in part, due to the lack of literature on the subject matter compared to the massive archives of technical design patterns. It is also due, in part, to the fact that it is human nature to use patterns in a similar manner to stencils - tracing the outlines without understanding the edges; every curve, line, twist, and turn in the shapes being drawn. In practice, patterns are often used interchangeably with specific features, copied as-is from one of the popular design pattern and wireframe libraries - see a full list in UXPinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Wireframing. Because I believe understanding patterns is fundamental to good product design and development, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve shared an abundance of these best practices with you to help you as you brainstorm, sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen a beautiful assortment of web applications outfitted with click, scroll, drag-and-drop, hover-enabled visual and functional solutions to the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everyday problems. To name a few, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve summarized patterns and elements of Pinterest, OKCupid, Spotify, Amazon, Kickstarter, AirBnB, Yelp, Facebook, Dropbox, Quora, LinkedIn, Gmail, Eventbrite, Twitter, Mint, Mailchimp, Asana, RelateIQ, Flipboard and many, many more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc481f581b33f71e204f6b56f543b7edc44e9f6","amp;dn":"Bank+Chris+-+Web+UI+Design+Patterns+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc481f581b33f71e204f6b56f543b7edc44e9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,196,129,245,129,179,63,113,226,4,246,181,111,84,59,126,220,68,233,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
