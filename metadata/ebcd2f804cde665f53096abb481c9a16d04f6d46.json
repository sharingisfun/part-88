Office Tab changes this by introducing a tabbed user interface - as seen in web browsers such as Internet ExplorerÃ‚Â® 8, Firefox and Google Chrome - in Microsoft Office 2016, 2013, 2010, 2007, 2003 and Office 365 (Word, ExcelÃ‚Â®, PowerPointÃ‚Â®, PublisherÃ‚Â®, AccessÃ‚Â®, Project and VisioÃ‚Â®)\n\nMain Features:\n- Open, read, edit, and manage multiple Office documents in a single tabbed window.\n- Minimize the number of windows you open at the same time.\n- Save and close all Office documents with one click.\n- Based on Microsoft Office add-in technology.\n\nSave All in One Click\nA key advantage of Office Tab is that you can save time by consolidating your actions! For example, if you've opened multiple files, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to save and close them individually; just click &quot;Save All&quot; from the Context menu and all your files are saved. Want to close all opened files? Simply select &quot;Close AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and all your files will be closed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebcd2f804cde665f53096abb481c9a16d04f6d46","amp;dn":"Office+Tab+Enterprise+10.0+%28x86%2Fx64%29+Multilingual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebcd2f804cde665f53096abb481c9a16d04f6d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,205,47,128,76,222,102,95,83,9,106,187,72,28,154,22,208,79,109,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
