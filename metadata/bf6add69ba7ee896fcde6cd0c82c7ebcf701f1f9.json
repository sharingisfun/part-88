The application includes the lunisolar Hindu calendar that allows you to view the date as it is considered in the Nepali culture.\nThe setup process is brief, but you are prompted to install additional fonts to your system, in case they are not already available. The application displays a small window onto the desktop, showing the current date in the Bikram Sambat (BS) system.\nThe actual calendar can be launched by choosing the designated option within the right-click context menu. It consists of a simple window where you can view all the months and days, with simple and comprehensive navigation tools that allow you to quickly switch to the next month.\nIn addition to this, the calendar bundles options for instantly jumping to a certain month, either in the Nepali calendar or the Christian one (with AD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anno Domini as the reference year). With the click of a button, you can also jump directly to the current day, which is immediately highlighted within the calendar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6add69ba7ee896fcde6cd0c82c7ebcf701f1f9","amp;dn":"Nepali+calendar+mitibar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6add69ba7ee896fcde6cd0c82c7ebcf701f1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,106,221,105,186,126,232,150,252,222,108,208,200,44,126,188,247,1,241,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
