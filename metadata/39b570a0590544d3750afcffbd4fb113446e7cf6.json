Oasis turns in a relatively introspective second record, filled with big, gorgeous ballads instead of ripping rockers.\n\nUnlike Definitely Maybe, the production on Morning Glory is varied enough to handle the range in emotions; instead of drowning everything with amplifiers turned up to 12, there are strings, keyboards, and harmonicas. This expanded production helps give Noel GallagherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweeping melodies an emotional resonance that he occasionally canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t convey lyrically. However, that is far from a fatal flaw; GallagherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics work best in fragments, where the images catch in your mind and grow, thanks to the music. Gallagher may be guilty of some borrowing, or even plagiarism, but he uses the familiar riffs as building blocks. This is where his genius lies: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thief and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have many original thoughts, but as a pop/rock melodicist heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much without peer. Likewise, as musicians, Oasis are hardly innovators, yet they have a majestic grandeur in their sound that makes ballads like Ã¢â‚¬Å“WonderwallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or rockers like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Might SayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ positively transcendent. Alan White does add authority to the rhythm section, but the most noticeable change is in Liam Gallagher. His voice sneered throughout Definitely Maybe, but on Morning Glory his singing has become more textured and skillful. He gives the lyric in the raging title track a hint of regret, is sympathetic on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wonderwall,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ defiant on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Might Say,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and humorous on Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Electric,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a bawdy rewrite of Ã¢â‚¬Å“DigsyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It might not have the immediate impact of Definitely Maybe, but Morning Glory is just as exciting and compulsively listenable.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b570a0590544d3750afcffbd4fb113446e7cf6","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+Whats+the+Story+Morning+Glory+%282014%29+3CD+Deluxe+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b570a0590544d3750afcffbd4fb113446e7cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,181,112,160,89,5,68,211,117,10,252,255,189,79,177,19,68,110,124,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
