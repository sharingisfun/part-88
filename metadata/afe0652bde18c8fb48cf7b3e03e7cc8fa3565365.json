Presenting state-of-the-art terahertz spectroscopic techniques, Terahertz Spectroscopy: Principles and Applications focuses on time-domain methods based on femtosecond laser sources and important recent applications in physics, materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine.\nThe first section of the book examines instrumentation and methods for terahertz spectroscopy. It provides a comprehensive treatment of time-domain terahertz spectroscopic measurements, including methods for the generation and detection of terahertz radiation, methods for determining optical constants from time-domain measurements, and the use of femtosecond time-resolved techniques. The last two sections explore a variety of applications of terahertz spectroscopy in physics, materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine.\n\nWith chapters contributed by leading experts in academia, industry, and research, this volume thoroughly discusses methods and applications, setting it apart from other recent books in this emerging terahertz field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe0652bde18c8fb48cf7b3e03e7cc8fa3565365","amp;dn":"Terahertz+Spectroscopy+-+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe0652bde18c8fb48cf7b3e03e7cc8fa3565365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,224,101,43,222,24,200,251,72,207,123,62,3,231,204,143,163,86,83,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
