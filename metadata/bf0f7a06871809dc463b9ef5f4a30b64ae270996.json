It was time to find a life for myself. To make something out of nothing. The end of hope and the beginning of it too.\n\nAfter moving with her husband to the tiny, bustling island of Macau, Grace Miller finds herself a stranger in a foreign landÃ¢â‚¬â€a lone redhead towering above the crowd on the busy Chinese streets. As she is forced to confront the devastating news of her infertility, GraceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage is fraying and her dreams of family have been shattered. She resolves to do something bold, something her impetuous mother would do, and she turns to what she loves: baking and the pleasure of afternoon tea.\n\nGrace opens a cafÃƒÂ© where she serves tea, coffee, and macaronsÃ¢â‚¬â€the delectable, delicate French cookies colored like precious stonesÃ¢â‚¬â€to the women of Macau. There, among fellow expatriates and locals alike, Grace carves out a new definition of home and family. But when her marriage reaches a crisis, secrets Grace thought she had buried long ago rise to the surface. Grace realizes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now or never to lay old ghosts to rest and to begin to trust herself. With each mug of coffee brewed, each cup of tea steeped and macaron baked, Grace comes to learn that strength can be gleaned from the unlikeliest of places.\n\nA delicious, melt-in-your-mouth novel featuring the sweet pleasures of French pastries and the exotic scents and sights of China, The Color of Tea is a scrumptious story of love, friendship and renewal.\n\n\nProduct Details:\nPublisher: Simon and Schuster\nFile size: epub mobi\nISBN: 978-1-4516-8705-7 (ebook)\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0f7a06871809dc463b9ef5f4a30b64ae270996","amp;dn":"The+Colour+of+Tea+ebook+by+Hannah+Tunnicliffe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0f7a06871809dc463b9ef5f4a30b64ae270996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,15,122,6,135,24,9,220,70,59,158,245,244,163,11,100,174,39,9,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
